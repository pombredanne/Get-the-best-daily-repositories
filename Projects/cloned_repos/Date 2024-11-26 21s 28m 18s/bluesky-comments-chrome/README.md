I decided to make a Chrome Extension to bring Bluesky comments to any web page :)

# How to use

## Download this code
However you please.

## Install the extension
- Go here: chrome://extensions/
- Enable dev mode (top right)
- Add the `dist` folder from this extension

## Activate it

## Crete an App password
- Go here: https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords
- Create a new one â€“ The name isn't important, but save the value

## Go to any web page

## Click the extension's icon

## The first time you'll be prompted to authenticate
- Use your full bluesky handle (eg, for me it's `joneslloyd.bsky.social`)
- Use the app password that you created above

## After this, the current page can be commented upon
