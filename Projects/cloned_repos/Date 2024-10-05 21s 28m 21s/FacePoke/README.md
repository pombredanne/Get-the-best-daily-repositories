## Introduction

A real-time head transformation app.

For best performance please run the app from your own machine (local or in the cloud).

**Repository**: [GitHub - jbilcke-hf/FacePoke](https://github.com/jbilcke-hf/FacePoke)

You can try the demo but it is a shared space, latency may be high if there are multiple users or if you live far from the datacenter hosting the Hugging Face Space.

**Live Demo**: [FacePoke on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jbilcke-hf/FacePoke)

## Acknowledgements

This project is based on LivePortrait: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03168

It uses the face transformation routines from https://github.com/PowerHouseMan/ComfyUI-AdvancedLivePortrait
