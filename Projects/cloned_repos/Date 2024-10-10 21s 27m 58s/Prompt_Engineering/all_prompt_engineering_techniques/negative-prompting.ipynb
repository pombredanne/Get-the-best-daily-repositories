    "# Negative Prompting and Avoiding Undesired Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial explores the concept of negative prompting and techniques for avoiding undesired outputs when working with large language models. We'll focus on using OpenAI's GPT models and the LangChain library to implement these strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "As AI language models become more powerful, it's crucial to guide their outputs effectively. Negative prompting allows us to specify what we don't want in the model's responses, helping to refine and control the generated content. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with sensitive topics, ensuring factual accuracy, or maintaining a specific tone or style in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "1. Using negative examples to guide the model\n",
    "2. Specifying exclusions in prompts\n",
    "3. Implementing constraints using LangChain\n",
    "4. Evaluating and refining negative prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "We'll start by setting up our environment with the necessary libraries. Then, we'll explore different techniques for negative prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic negative examples: We'll demonstrate how to provide examples of undesired outputs to guide the model.\n",
    "2. Explicit exclusions: We'll use prompts that specifically state what should not be included in the response.\n",
    "3. Constraint implementation: Using LangChain, we'll create more complex prompts that enforce specific constraints on the output.\n",
    "4. Evaluation and refinement: We'll discuss methods to assess the effectiveness of our negative prompts and iteratively improve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the tutorial, we'll use practical examples to illustrate these concepts and provide code snippets for implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of negative prompting techniques and how to apply them to avoid undesired outputs from language models. These skills will enable you to create more controlled, accurate, and appropriate AI-generated content for various applications."

      "Exercise offers a multitude of benefits that extend beyond physical appearance. Engaging in regular physical activity enhances mental well-being by reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, and promoting a sense of accomplishment and improved mood through the release of endorphins. It also boosts cognitive function, improving memory and concentration, which can lead to greater productivity in daily tasks. Additionally, exercise strengthens the cardiovascular system, increases stamina, and supports overall health by enhancing immune function and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Ultimately, incorporating exercise into oneâ€™s routine fosters a greater sense of vitality and resilience in daily life.\n"
