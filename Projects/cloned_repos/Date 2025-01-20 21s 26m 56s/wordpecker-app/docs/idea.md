Learning a new language can be straightforward, but mastering it is the real challenge. While it's relatively easy to grasp the basics, developing strong communication or reading skills depends on having a solid vocabulary. To build this, you must learn words and phrases at various levels, yet exposure is key. For instance, if you've studied English but don’t live in an English-speaking country, advancing your skills becomes significantly harder. You can read books, watch movies, or browse blogs, but fully immersing yourself in the language is still difficult. Real progress often requires extra effort—studying and revisiting words and phrases encountered in your daily life.

However, this process can be inconvenient. You have to pause whatever you’re doing to note new words, search their meanings, record them, and then review them later. This is time-consuming and tiring. As a result, although you might improve, the learning process can feel painfully slow and inefficient.

To solve this, I have an idea for an app that merges personalized learning with the efficiency of flashcards—a blend of Duolingo-like lessons and custom study lists.

Imagine you’re reading a book—say, Harry Potter. As you come across unfamiliar words, you open the app and create a new list with details like:

- Name: Harry Potter Book
- Description: The first book in the series
- Context: Harry Potter
Once the list is created, you add the words or phrases you’ve found. The app automatically provides their meanings in context after you save them, so you can continue reading without interruption.

Later, you revisit the list and pick one of two options: Learn or Quiz.

- Learn: This mode delivers structured lessons in a Duolingo style. Text, visuals, and exercises are dynamically generated using LLMs.
- Quiz: When you’re ready, you can test what you’ve learned through interactive quizzes. They’re engaging and gamified, awarding points and showing your progress. For example, it might indicate you’ve mastered 75% of your list.
The key advantage is that the app keeps your learning tied to the context in which you originally saw the words. By returning to them in their original setting, you strengthen those specific neural pathways, speeding up retention and making learning significantly more effective.

In short, it’s like having a personalized Duolingo where you can create and learn from your own lists. It’s a powerful way to immerse yourself in the language and make steady progress.
