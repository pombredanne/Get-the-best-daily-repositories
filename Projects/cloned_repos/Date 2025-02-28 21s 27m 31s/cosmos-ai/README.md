## Overview
Cosmos-AI is an innovative solution that leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence algorithms for intelligent task decomposition, allocation, and collaborative scheduling. Our goal is to enhance the efficiency of managing complex project workflows by providing a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-integrate tool that boosts productivity and fosters better team collaboration.

## Key Features
- **Intelligent Task Decomposition**: Automatically break down complex project tasks into actionable subtasks using advanced AI algorithms.
- **Collaborative Scheduling**: Optimize task allocation based on team members' skills and current workload to ensure maximum resource utilization.
- **Seamless Integration**: Supports integration with popular project management tools like Jira, Trello, etc., streamlining your workflow.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Team members can view task updates and progress in real-time, enhancing communication and coordination.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
