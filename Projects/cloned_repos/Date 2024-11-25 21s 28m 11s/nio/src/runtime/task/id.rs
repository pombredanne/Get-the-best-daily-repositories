/// # Notes
///
/// - Task IDs are unique relative to other *currently running* tasks. When a
///   task completes, the same ID may be used for another task.
/// - Task IDs are *not* sequential, and do not indicate the order in which
///   tasks are spawned, what runtime a task is spawned on, or any other data.
/// - The task ID of the currently running task can be obtained from inside the
///   task via the [`task::try_id()`](crate::task::try_id()) and
///   [`task::id()`](crate::task::id()) functions and from outside the task via
///   the [`JoinHandle::id()`](crate::task::JoinHandle::id()) function.
