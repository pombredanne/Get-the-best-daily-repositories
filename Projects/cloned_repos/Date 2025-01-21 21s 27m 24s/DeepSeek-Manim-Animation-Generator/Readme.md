# DeepSeek-Manim Animation Generator

## Author's Note

I originally wrote this repository before DeepSeek published their official API. As such, you can ignore the Colab notebook and Hugging Face model download instructions - they're obsolete now that DeepSeek has released their API!

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `.env` file and add your DeepSeek API key:
   ```
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Gradio interface:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. Use the chat interface to ask DeepSeek to create any Manim animation
6. Copy the returned Python script to a new .py file
7. Run the animation using Manim's CLI

## Local APP Features

### Real-time Reasoning Display
The chat interface now shows the AI's reasoning process in real-time! As you interact with the model, you'll see:
- A gray box above each response showing the model's chain of thought
- The final response below the reasoning
- Both updating in real-time as the model thinks

This feature helps you understand how the AI arrives at its conclusions. The reasoning window shows the intermediate steps and thought process before the final answer is given.




## Running Manim Animations

### Basic Command Structure
```bash
python -m manim [flags] your_script.py SceneName
```
The `SceneName` must match the name of the scene class defined in your script. For example, in my case, R1 returned a class called `class QEDJourney(ThreeDScene):`, then you would use:
```bash
python -m manim [flags] QED.py QEDJourney
```
You can choose to use docker to render a manim scene : `docker run --rm -it -v "/path/to/repo/Deepseek-R1-Zero:/manim" manimcommunity/manim manim -qm QED.py QEDJourney` 
https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/docker.html

### Quality Options
- `-ql` (480p, fastest, best for development)
- `-qm` (720p, good balance)
- `-qh` (1080p, high quality)
- `-qk` (4K, very high quality)

### Preview Options
- `-p` Preview the animation when done
- `-f` Show the output file in file browser

### Partial Rendering
When debugging or resuming after an error, you can render specific parts of your animation:
```bash
# Start from a specific animation number
python -m manim -qh --from-animation 11 your_script.py SceneName

# Render a specific range of animations
python -m manim -qh --from-animation 11 --upto-animation 15 your_script.py SceneName
```
This is particularly useful for:
- Resuming after errors without re-rendering everything
- Debugging specific sections of your animation
- Saving time during development

### Output Formats
- Default: MP4
- `-i` Output as GIF
- `--format VIDEO` Choose format (mp4, mov, gif, webm)

### Output Location
All rendered animations are saved in:
```
media/videos/[script_name]/[quality]/[scene_name].[format]
```

### Development Tips
1. Use `-pql` during development for quick previews
2. Use `-qh` for final renders
3. Add `-f` to easily locate output files
4. Use `--format gif` for easily shareable animations

For example:
```bash
# During development (preview QEDJourney scene from QED.py in low quality)
python -m manim -pql QED.py QEDJourney

# Final render (render QEDJourney scene from QED.py in high quality)
python -m manim -qh QED.py QEDJourney
```

## **1. Introduction**

DeepSeek R1-Zero represents the culmination of **multi-year research** at DeepSeek AI into **transfer learning**, **instruction tuning**, and **long-context neural architectures**. Its central objective is to provide a single, all-purpose encoder-decoder model that can handle:

- **Complex reading comprehension** (up to 8,192 tokens)  
- **Scenario-based instruction following** (e.g., "Given a set of constraints, produce a short plan.")  
- **Technical and coding tasks** (including code generation, transformation, and debugging assistance)  

Though R1-Zero is a "descendant" of T5, the modifications to attention, context management, and parameter initialization distinguish it significantly from vanilla T5 implementations.

---

## **2. Philosophical & Theoretical Foundations**

While standard Transformer models rely on the "Attention is All You Need" paradigm (Vaswani et al., 2017), **DeepSeek R1-Zero** extends this by:

1. **Expanded Context Window**  
   - By employing distributed positional encodings and segment-based attention, R1-Zero tolerates sequences up to 8,192 tokens.  
   - The extended context window leverages **blockwise local attention** (in certain layers) to mitigate quadratic scaling in memory usage.

2. **Instruction Tuning**  
   - Similar to frameworks like FLAN-T5 or InstructGPT, R1-Zero was exposed to curated prompts (instructions, Q&A, conversation) to improve zero-shot and few-shot performance.  
   - This approach helps the model produce more stable, context-aware answers and reduces "hallucination" events.

3. **Semantic Compression**  
   - The encoder can compress textual segments into "semantic slots," enabling more efficient cross-attention in the decoder stage.  
   - This is theoretically grounded in **Manifold Hypothesis** arguments, where the textual input can be seen as lying on a lower-dimensional manifold, thus amenable to a compressed representation.

From a **cognitive science** perspective, R1-Zero aspires to mimic a layered approach to knowledge assimilation, balancing short-term "working memory" (sequence tokens) with long-term "knowledge representation" (model parameters).

## **3. Model Architecture**

### **3.1 Summary of Structural Modifications**

- **Parameter Count**: ~6.7B  
- **Encoder-Decoder**: Maintains T5's text-to-text approach but with specialized gating and partial reordering in cross-attention blocks.  
- **Context Window**: 8,192 tokens (a 4Ã— expansion over many standard T5 models).  
- **Layer Stacking**: The modifications allow some dynamic scheduling of attention heads, facilitating better throughput in multi-GPU environments.

## **4. Installation & Quickstart**

Below are **simplified** instructions for installing DeepSeek R1-Zero:

### **4.1 Requirements**

- **Python** >= 3.8  
- **PyTorch** >= 2.0  
- **Transformers** >= 4.34.0  
- **Accelerate** >= 0.24.0  
- **bitsandbytes** >= 0.39.0 (if using 4-bit/8-bit)
- **FFmpeg** (required for video rendering)

### **4.1.1 Installing FFmpeg**

FFmpeg is required for Manim to render animations. Here's how to install it:

#### Windows:
1. Download from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ 
   - Recommended: "ffmpeg-release-essentials.7z"
2. Extract the archive
3. Add the `bin` folder to your system PATH
   - Or install via package manager: `choco install ffmpeg`

#### Linux:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

#### macOS:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

### **4.2 Installing via `pip`**

```bash
pip install --upgrade torch transformers accelerate bitsandbytes
```

If your environment's default PyTorch is older than 2.0, consider updating or installing from PyPI/conda channels that provide a recent version.

### **4.3 Model Download**

After installing prerequisites, you can load the model from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Zero). For example:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Zero",
    trust_remote_code=True
)

model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(
    "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Zero",
    trust_remote_code=True,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,   # or torch.float32
    device_map="auto"           # automatically move model to GPU if available
)
```

> **Note**:  
> 1) `trust_remote_code=True` is essential because R1-Zero uses custom code.  
> 2) Download times may be substantial (potentially hours) depending on your bandwidth and how Hugging Face shards large models.

## **5. Quantization & Memory Footprint**

DeepSeek R1-Zero supports **multi-bit quantization** to optimize memory usage:

1. **4-Bit Quantization**  
   - **Pros**: Minimizes VRAM usage (~8GB).  
   - **Cons**: Potentially minor losses in numeric accuracy or generative quality.

2. **8-Bit Quantization**  
   - **Pros**: Still significantly reduces memory (~14GB VRAM).  
   - **Cons**: Slight overhead vs. 4-bit but often better fidelity.

3. **Full Precision (FP32)**  
   - **Pros**: The highest theoretical accuracy.  
   - **Cons**: ~28GB VRAM usage, not feasible on smaller GPUs.

Sample quantized load (4-bit) with [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes):

```python
model_4bit = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(
    "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Zero",
    trust_remote_code=True,
    device_map="auto",
    load_in_4bit=True
)
```

## **6. Implementation Details**

### **6.1 Memory Management**

- **Sharded Checkpoints**: The model is split into multiple shards; each shard is verified upon download. Large shards can be memory-mapped, so your system requirements also include disk I/O overhead.  
- **Accelerate Integration**: By leveraging [Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate), you can distribute model shards across multiple GPUs or perform CPU offloading if GPU memory is insufficient.

### **6.2 Extended Context Mechanism**

- **Rotary & Segment Encodings**: At large sequence lengths, standard absolute positions can degrade performance. R1-Zero's hybrid approach (inspired by [T5], [LongT5], and [RoFormer]) helps maintain stable gradients even at 8k tokens.  
- **Parallel Cross-Attention**: The decoder employs a specialized parallel cross-attention mechanism in certain layers, which can reduce overhead in multi-GPU setups.

---

## **7. Performance Benchmarks**

**DeepSeek R1-Zero** typically competes near GPT-3.5 performance in standard generative benchmarks:

- **Inference Latency**  
  - 4-bit: ~100â€“200ms per token (varies by GPU)  
  - FP16: ~200â€“400ms per token  
  - FP32: ~400â€“800ms per token

- **Quality Metrics**  
  - **BLEU & ROUGE**: On summarization tasks (CNN/DailyMail), R1-Zero hovers at ~1â€“2 points below GPT-3.5.  
  - **Open Domain QA**: On NaturalQuestions, R1-Zero closely matches strong baselines (e.g., T5-XXL) when properly instructed.

Keep in mind that your hardware setup and parallelism strategies can influence these benchmarks significantly.

---

## **8. Potential Limitations & Future Work**

Despite R1-Zero's strengths, several **limitations** persist:

1. **Token Context Limit**: 8,192 tokens is high, but certain extreme use cases (e.g., full-text searching in large documents) may require bridging or chunking.  
2. **Training Biases**: While instruction-tuning reduces hallucinations, domain gaps remain. For heavily specialized or newly emerging knowledge, the model may produce uncertain or dated information.  
3. **Interpretability**: Like all Transformer-based LLMs, R1-Zero functions as a "black box." Advanced interpretability tools are still an active research area.

**Future Directions**:  
- Integrating advanced memory systems to handle prompts beyond 8k tokens.  
- Incorporating **flash attention** for further speed-ups.  
- Investigating retrieval-augmented generation modules to reduce outdated knowledge reliance.

## **9. Usage Examples**

Below are a few quick examples to illustrate R1-Zero's capabilities:

### **9.1 Short Story Generation**

```python
prompt = "Write a short sci-fi story about artificial intelligence."
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
output_ids = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=150)
print(tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

### **9.2 Technical Explanation**

```python
prompt = "Explain the concept of gradient descent as if speaking to a first-year PhD student."
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
output_ids = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=200)
print(tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

Feel free to refine these prompts and tune generation parameters (`num_beams`, `temperature`, `top_k`, etc.) to shape the style.
