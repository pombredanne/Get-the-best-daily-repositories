# FULL v0 System Prompts AND AI models used by v0

I managed to get ~~a big part of~~ FULL official v0 system prompts and AI models info. Over 2.2k lines

# Any questions or suggestions for other platforms? ---> Open an issue.

LATEST UPDATE: 06/03/2025

You can check it out in v0.txt and v0 model.txt

~~And now the question is, what model is v0 using? soon. ðŸ‘€~~ v0 AI MODELS INFO RELEASED! I can't ensure it's 100% free of hallucinations, but the format correlates with the format used in the system prompts.

The default model of v0 is GPT-4o, and for reasoning, it uses DeepSeek. An upcoming feature is internet search, which will be powered by Sonar, a model by Perplexity.
