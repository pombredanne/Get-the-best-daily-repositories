# o1 Playground

A playground for OpenAI's o1 models.

Improvements coming soon!

## Demo

Latest demo [here](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1834721745179492735).

## Requirements

You will need an OpenAI API key.

Get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

As of September 13th, 2024, you will need to be an organization with Tier 5 access to use o1 models.

We hope to see o1 models available to all users soon, and we'll be ready for you!

### Using o1 models via OpenRouter

If you have an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) account, create an API key and add the following to `.env.local`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<openrouter api key>
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
```

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mckaywrigley/o1-ai-playground.git
```

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
