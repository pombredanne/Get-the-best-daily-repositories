# Pitch

## Problem

Solana is a high-speed blockchain network that requires fast, stable validator nodes, with high decentralization across the data centers in the world. At the time of writing, there are currently about 3500 validators on the Testnet and about 1400 on the Mainnet. Many of these nodes are set up using various guides and information scattered across the internet.

This leads to ad-hoc, unique installations with inconsistent software versions, settings, configurations, and user profiles. Furthermore, a significant number of people running validator nodes have little to no expertise in system administration, troubleshooting, or monitoring. This high knowledge entry barrier often limits validator setups to a small number of data centers mentioned in popular guides and tutorials.

These challenges result in:

Reduced cluster performance, stability, resilience, and decentralization.

Difficulty in providing effective support in cases of validator failure or poor performance.

## Solution

Lumen AI provides a robust, AI-powered toolkit that enables seamless validator node setup, management, and monitoring. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Infrastructure-as-Code principles, Lumen AI simplifies the process for both novice and experienced users while ensuring consistent and optimized configurations across the network.

### Key components of the solution:

- One-Click Validator Setup: An interactive shell script powered by AI that adapts settings based on user requirements and best practices.
- AI-Powered Monitoring and Diagnostics: An advanced system for monitoring node health, network performance, and cluster dynamics, enriched by predictive analytics to anticipate and resolve issues before they occur.
- Ansible Playbooks: For experienced users, offering a flexible and extensible foundation for advanced customization.
- Multilingual AI Assistant: Providing real-time support, troubleshooting advice, and guidance in multiple languages.

### Features already implemented:

- Node bootstrapping with optimized AI-guided settings.
- Automated Solana version upgrades.
- AI-enhanced monitoring dashboards with actionable insights.
- Basic alert system (via Telegram bot and other channels).

### Currently being developed:

- Standalone Monitoring System: Enabling anyone to deploy a private, AI-enhanced monitoring and alerting platform, complete with dashboards and advanced analytics.
- Predictive Maintenance: AI models that predict potential node issues and recommend solutions proactively.

### Future plans:

- Advanced Alerting System: AI-driven alerting that dynamically adjusts thresholds based on context and historical data.
- Disaster Recovery: AI-assisted recovery plans for node or cluster failures.
- Mobile Cockpit: A mobile app for real-time alerts, notifications, and node management.
- Open API: Providing seamless integration for external systems to access monitoring data and insights.
- Automated Node Startup: AI-managed cluster restart solutions.
- Customizable AI Models: Allowing users to tailor AI models for specific operational goals.
- By integrating AI into every step of the process, Lumen AI reduces the knowledge barrier and enables a broader audience to contribute to the Solana network, thereby improving its decentralization, resilience, and overall performance.

## Competition

## Why Us?

Our multi-disciplinary team combines decades of expertise in engineering, development, monitoring, operations, and security across application and infrastructure domains. With over 20+ years of experience, we are uniquely positioned to deliver an AI-powered solution that addresses the core challenges of Solana validator management.

## Amount

Depending on the available funding, we would be able to dedicate a varying amount of our time to this project. Better funding means we would be able to fully achieve the goals listed above and do it faster, while also offering more support for the Solana Validator community.

We see the SV-Manager as a long-term project that needs to be constantly developed and enhanced together with Solana, and we see its future as being most successful in close cooperation with the Solana Foundation
