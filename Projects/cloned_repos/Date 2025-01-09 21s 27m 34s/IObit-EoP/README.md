# Description

* The PoC program exploits the IMFForceDelete driver which exposes an ioctl that allows unprivileged users to delete files and folders. We can turn this into a privilege escalation by using a technique explained by ZDI and Halov, which exploits the MSI rollback mechanism which is designed to maintain system integrity in case of issues. By deleting and recreating it with a weak DACL and fake RBF and RBS files we can gain the ability to make arbitrary changes to the system as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.
