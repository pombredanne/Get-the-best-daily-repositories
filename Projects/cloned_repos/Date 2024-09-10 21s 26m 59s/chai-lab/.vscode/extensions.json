// We use Dev Containers to run the code in a container. As a result,
// VS Code runs extensions in one of two places: locally on the UI /
// client side, or in the container. When adding extensions, take care
// to ensure you add them to the right list: container extensions should
// be added to the list in ../.devcontainer/devcontainer.json, and UI
// extensions should be added to the list below. See
// https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_managing-extensions
