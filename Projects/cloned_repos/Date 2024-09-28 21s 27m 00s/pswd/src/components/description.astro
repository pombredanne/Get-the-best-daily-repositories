      <h2>Why do I need secure passwords?</h2>
      <p>
        Secure passwords protect your personal information and online accounts
        from unauthorized access and cyber threats. Weak or guessable passwords
        make it easy for hackers to breach your accounts, leading to identity
        theft, financial loss, and privacy issues. Using strong, unique
        passwords significantly lowers the risk of data breaches and keeps your
        sensitive information safe. Investing in secure passwords is essential
        for safeguarding your digital life and maintaining online security.

      <h2>How Are Passwords Generated in PSWD?</h2>
      <p>
        Passwords are generated entirely in your browser using the
        <code>window.crypto.getRandomValues</code> API, which provides cryptographically
        secure random numbers. Our <a
          href="https://github.com/remvze/pswd/blob/main/src/helpers/crypto.ts"
          >generation function</a
        > carefully handles potential biases by discarding values outside the desired
        range. All processing occurs locally on your device, and no password data
        is ever sent to or stored on our servers. This ensures that only you have
        access to your generated passwords, maintaining your privacy and security.
