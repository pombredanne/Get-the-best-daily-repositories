**Video Title:** Excel for Beginners Tutorial - Quick Introduction to Excel (Video URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tdlR1rBwkM)

**(Upbeat music)**

**Introduction to Excel Interface**

This tutorial will provide a quick introduction to Excel, helping you become comfortable with the application. You'll gain an understanding of the layout, where to find different elements, and how to input values.

**Getting Started: Opening Excel and Creating a Workbook**

When you open Excel on your desktop, you will first see the Excel start screen.

*   **Options:**
    *   **Blank workbook:**  Start with a fresh, empty spreadsheet.
    *   **Recent files:** If you have recently worked on Excel files, they will be displayed here for quick access.

For this tutorial, we will create a **blank workbook**.

**Saving Your Workbook**

*   **Initial State:** A newly created workbook is not saved until you explicitly choose to save it.
*   **Saving Process:**
    *   Go to the **"File"** tab (likely located in the top left corner).
    *   Click on **"Save"**.
    *   Choose the location where you want to save your file.
*   **Shortcut:** You can also use the shortcut key **Ctrl + S** to save your workbook.

**Understanding Excel Files: Workbooks and Sheets**

*   **Terminology:** A single Excel file is referred to as a **workbook** or a **spreadsheet**. These terms are interchangeable.
*   **Workbooks Contain Sheets:** A workbook is composed of at least one **sheet**.
*   **Adding Sheets:**
    *   To add more sheets to your workbook, click on the **plus (+) icon** typically located next to the existing sheet name(s) at the bottom of the Excel window.
*   **Renaming Sheets:**
    *   **Double-click** on the current sheet name (e.g., "Sheet1").
    *   Type in the **new name** you desire for the sheet.
    *   Press **Enter** to finalize the sheet name change.

**Working with Cells: The Building Blocks of a Sheet**

*   **Cells Defined:** A **cell** is an individual rectangular box within a sheet.  Think of it as the fundamental unit of a spreadsheet.
*   **Inputting Data:**
    *   You can enter **numbers** or **text** into a cell.
    *   To input data, simply **select a cell** (click on it).
    *   Begin **typing** your desired value.
    *   Press **Enter** to confirm the input and move to the cell below by default.
*   **Replacing Cell Content:**
    *   To overwrite existing content in a cell, simply **select the cell** you want to modify.
    *   Start **typing** the new value directly. The previous content will be replaced automatically without needing to double-click first.

**Cell Addresses: Locating Cells within a Sheet**

*   **Cell Address System:** Each cell has a unique **address** based on its column and row position.
*   **Column and Row Labels:** Columns are labeled with letters (A, B, C, ...) and rows are labeled with numbers (1, 2, 3, ...).
*   **Determining Cell Address:** The cell address is formed by combining the column letter followed by the row number.
    *   For example, the cell at the intersection of column **D** and row **4** has the address **D4**.
*   **Intersection:** A cell is essentially the **intersection of a column and a row**.

**Formula Bar and Name Box: Key Interface Elements**

*   **Formula Bar:** Located above the spreadsheet grid, this bar displays the content of the currently selected (active) cell.
    *   **Text Display:** If a cell contains text, the formula bar will show the text value.
    *   **Formula Display:** If a cell contains a formula, the formula bar will show the actual formula, not the result of the formula.
    *   **Example:** If cell D4 contains the text "Hello", the formula bar will display "Hello". If another cell (e.g., E4) contains the formula `=D4`, the formula bar when cell E4 is selected will show `=D4`, even though cell E4 will display the value "Hello" (if D4 contains "Hello").

*   **Name Box:** Located to the left of the formula bar, the name box serves two primary functions:
    *   **Displays Active Cell Address:** It shows the address of the currently selected cell. For instance, if cell D4 is active, the name box will display "D4". If cell F4 is active, it will display "F4".
    *   **Jump to Specific Cell:** You can use the name box to quickly navigate to any cell within the sheet.
        *   **Procedure:**
            1.  Click into the **Name Box**.
            2.  Type the **cell address** you want to jump to (e.g., "A100").
            3.  Press **Enter**. Excel will immediately move the active cell to the specified address.
        *   **Example:** To jump to cell A100, type "A100" into the Name Box and press Enter.

*   **Shortcut to Return to A1:**  The shortcut key **Ctrl + Home** will always take you back to cell **A1**, the top-left cell of the sheet.

**Selecting Rows, Columns, and Ranges**

*   **Selecting Multiple Rows or Columns (Using Mouse):**
    *   **Rows:** Click and drag down on the row numbers (1, 2, 3...) on the left side of the sheet to select multiple rows.
    *   **Columns:** Click and drag across the column letters (A, B, C...) at the top of the sheet to select multiple columns.

*   **Selecting Entire Columns (Using Shortcut):**
    *   **Ctrl + Spacebar:** Selects the entire column in which the currently active cell resides.

*   **Selecting Multiple Columns (Using Shortcut and Mouse/Keyboard):**
    *   **Shift + Arrow Keys (with Column Selected):** After selecting a column using **Ctrl + Spacebar**, hold down the **Shift** key and use the **left or right arrow keys** to extend the selection to adjacent columns.

*   **Further Excel Shortcuts:** There are many more shortcuts in Excel. A separate video dedicated to Excel shortcuts is linked in the video description (not provided in this text).

**Right-Click Options: Context-Sensitive Menus**

*   **Accessing Options:** Right-clicking within the Excel grid (on cells, rows, or columns) brings up context-sensitive menus offering various options related to the clicked area.
*   **Cell Right-Click Options (Examples):**
    *   **Insert:** Insert new cells, rows, or columns.
    *   **Delete:** Delete cells, rows, or columns.
    *   **Clear Contents:** Remove the data from the selected cell(s) but keep the cell formatting.

*   **Column Right-Click Options (Examples - in addition to cell options):**
    *   **Column Width:** Adjust the width of the selected column(s).
    *   **Hide/Unhide:** Temporarily hide or reveal selected columns.

**Shortcuts for Inserting and Deleting Rows/Columns**

*   **Insert Rows or Columns:** **Ctrl + Plus Key (+)**
    *   This shortcut inserts new rows or columns based on your current selection.
*   **Delete Rows or Columns:** **Ctrl + Minus Key (-)**
    *   This shortcut deletes selected rows or columns.

**Excel Sheet Size: Columns and Rows Limits**

*   **Column Limit:** An Excel sheet contains more than **16,000 columns**.
*   **Row Limit:** An Excel sheet contains over **one million rows**.

*   **Navigating to the Last Row and Column:**
    *   **Last Row:** **Ctrl + Down Arrow Key** - Jumps to the very last row containing data in the current column, or the absolute last row if the column is empty below the current cell.
    *   **Last Column:** **Ctrl + Right Arrow Key** - Jumps to the very last column containing data in the current row, or the absolute last column if the row is empty to the right of the current cell.

*   **Returning to Cell A1:** Remember, **Ctrl + Home** brings you back to the top-left corner (cell A1).

**Ranges: Working with Groups of Cells**

*   **Range Definition:** A **range** is a contiguous group of two or more cells.
*   **Selecting a Range (Using Mouse):**
    *   Click on the **first cell** you want to include in the range.
    *   **Drag** your mouse to select the rest of the cells to be included in the range.
*   **Selecting a Range (Using Keyboard):**
    *   Select the **first cell** of the desired range.
    *   Hold down the **Shift key**.
    *   Use the **arrow keys** to extend the selection to include the desired cells.
*   **Referencing a Range (Range Address):**
    *   Ranges are referenced using the address of the **top-left cell** and the address of the **bottom-right cell**, separated by a **colon (:).**
    *   **Syntax:** `[Top-Left Cell Address]:[Bottom-Right Cell Address]`
    *   **Example:**  A range starting at cell D4 and ending at cell F7 would be referenced as **D4:F7**.
    *   **Usage:** Range addresses are commonly used in formulas to specify the cells that a formula should operate on.

**Cell Handles: Selection, Move, and Fill**

Excel provides different "handles" that appear when you interact with cell borders and corners, each with a specific function:

*   **Selection Handle (Default Mouse Icon):**
    *   Mouse icon appearance:  A **white, thick plus sign**.
    *   Function:  **Selecting cells or ranges.**
        *   **Single Cell Selection:** Click on a cell.
        *   **Range Selection:** Click and drag across multiple cells.

*   **Move Handle:**
    *   Mouse icon appearance: A **four-headed arrow**.
    *   Appearance Location: Appears when you hover the mouse cursor over the **border** of a selected cell or range.
    *   Function: **Moving cell content.**
        *   **Procedure:**
            1.  Hover over the cell border until the move handle appears.
            2.  Click and drag the cell (or range) to a new location.
            3.  Release the mouse button to drop the content in the new location.
        *   **Cut and Paste Shortcut:** Moving content can also be achieved using the standard **Cut (Ctrl + X)** and **Paste (Ctrl + V)** shortcuts.

*   **Fill Handle:**
    *   Mouse icon appearance: A **thin, black plus sign (+)**.
    *   Appearance Location: Appears when you hover the mouse cursor over the **small square** at the **bottom-right corner** of a selected cell.
    *   Function: **Filling cells with content based on the selected cell(s).**
        *   **Text Fill:** Dragging the fill handle from a cell containing text will copy the text to the cells you drag over.
        *   **Formula Fill:** Dragging the fill handle from a cell containing a formula will copy the formula down (or across), automatically adjusting cell references in the formula relative to their new rows (or columns).
        *   **Example:** If cell F4 contains the formula `=D4`, dragging the fill handle down to F5 will copy the formula to F5, but it will become `=D5` automatically.

**Adjusting Cell Size: Column Width and Row Height**

*   **Default Cell Size:** Cells have a default width and height.
*   **Text Overflow:** If text in a cell is longer than the current column width, it will visually "overflow" into adjacent cells to the right *if those cells are empty*. However, the content is still only stored in the original cell. You can verify this by checking the formula bar when selecting different cells.
*   **Adjusting Column Width (Manual Drag):**
    *   Hover your mouse cursor over the **vertical line** that separates column letters in the column header row (e.g., between 'A' and 'B').
    *   The cursor will change to a **double-headed arrow**.
    *   Click and drag to the right to **widen** the column, or to the left to **narrow** it.
*   **Adjusting Column Width (Double-Click for Auto-Fit):**
    *   Hover the mouse cursor over the vertical line between column letters.
    *   **Double-click**. The column width will automatically adjust to be just wide enough to display the longest content within that column.
*   **Text Wrapping: Vertical Expansion Instead of Horizontal Overflow**
    *   **Purpose:** To make text fit within a fixed column width by allowing it to wrap vertically within the cell, increasing the row height as needed.
    *   **Enabling Text Wrap:**
        1.  Select the cell(s) where you want to wrap text.
        2.  Go to the **"Home"** tab on the Ribbon.
        3.  In the **"Alignment"** group, click on the **"Wrap Text"** button. (It looks like text lines wrapped within a cell icon).
    *   **Adjusting Row Height After Wrapping:** After applying text wrap, if the entire wrapped text is not visible vertically, you may need to adjust the row height:
        *   **Manual Row Height Adjustment (Drag):** Hover over the **horizontal line** between row numbers on the left side (e.g., between '1' and '2'). Drag down to increase row height.
        *   **Auto-Fit Row Height (Double-Click):** Hover over the horizontal line between row numbers and **double-click**. The row height will automatically adjust to fit all wrapped text.
    *   **Disabling Text Wrap:** To undo text wrapping, simply click the **"Wrap Text"** button again to toggle it off.

**Right-Click Menu Options: Context-Specific Actions**

*   **Cell Right-Click Menu:** Right-clicking on a cell provides a menu with common actions:
    *   **Insert:** Insert cells, rows, or columns.
    *   **Delete:** Delete cells, rows, or columns.
    *   **Clear Contents:** Remove data from cells.
    *   **Add Comment:** Insert a comment associated with the cell.
    *   ... (and more options)

*   **Column Right-Click Menu:** Right-clicking on a column header provides options specific to columns, along with some general cell options:
    *   **Insert:** Insert columns.
    *   **Delete:** Delete columns.
    *   **Column Width:** Adjust column width.
    *   **Hide/Unhide:** Hide or unhide columns.
    *   ... (and more options)

**Exploring the Excel Menu: The Ribbon**

*   **Ribbon Terminology:** The menu bar in Excel is commonly referred to as the **Ribbon**.
*   **Tab-Based Structure:** The Ribbon is organized into different **tabs** (e.g., "Home", "Insert", "Page Layout", "Formulas", "Data", "Review", "View", etc.).
*   **Contextual Menus:** Clicking on different tabs changes the options displayed in the Ribbon menu bar, providing context-specific tools and features.
*   **Home Tab:** The **"Home"** tab is the most frequently used tab. It contains options for:
    *   **Formatting:** Font styles, number formats, cell styles, alignment, etc.
    *   **Common Actions:** Inserting and deleting cells, rows, and columns; sorting and filtering data.
*   **Insert Tab:** The **"Insert"** tab provides options for inserting various objects into your spreadsheet:
    *   **Charts:** Create different types of charts and graphs.
    *   **Pivot Tables:** Create pivot tables for data summarization and analysis.
    *   **Pictures, Shapes, Symbols, etc.**

*   **Feature Information and Shortcuts (Tooltips):** Hovering your mouse cursor over a feature or button in the Ribbon will often display a **tooltip** that provides:
    *   **Description of the feature's function.**
    *   **Shortcut key** (if one exists) for that feature.
*   **Ribbon Exploration Recommendation:**  It is beneficial to spend time exploring the different tabs and options within the Ribbon to become familiar with Excel's capabilities.

**Hiding Gridlines: Customizing Sheet Appearance**

*   **Gridlines:** The default sheet display includes gridlines (light gray lines) that outline cells.
*   **Hiding Gridlines (for Reports and Dashboards):**  For cleaner-looking reports or dashboards, you might want to hide gridlines.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Go to the **"Page Layout"** tab on the Ribbon.
        2.  In the **"Gridlines"** group, **uncheck** the **"View"** checkbox.
        *   The gridlines will disappear from the sheet view.
    *   **Re-enabling Gridlines:** To bring gridlines back, simply **check** the **"View"** checkbox again.

**Dialogue Boxes: Accessing More Options**

*   **Dialogue Box Launchers:** Some groups of options in the Ribbon have a small, tilted arrow in the bottom-right corner of the group box (called a **dialogue box launcher**).
*   **Accessing Dialogue Boxes:** Clicking on these arrows opens a **dialogue box** related to that group of options.
*   **Dialogue Box Content:**
    *   Dialogue boxes often contain **duplicates** of options already available in the Ribbon, but they may present them in a different organizational structure.
    *   Dialogue boxes may also provide **additional, more advanced options** that are not directly available in the Ribbon itself.

**Collapsing and Pinning the Ribbon: Maximizing Worksheet Space**

*   **Collapsing the Ribbon (Hiding):** To increase the visible worksheet area, you can temporarily collapse (hide) the Ribbon.
    *   **Method 1 (Arrow Button):** Click on the **upward-pointing arrow** located in the top-right corner of the Ribbon (usually to the right of the tabs).
    *   **Method 2 (Shortcut):** Use the shortcut key **Ctrl + F1**.
    *   **Behavior when Collapsed:** When the Ribbon is collapsed, it will only appear temporarily when you click on a tab. It will disappear again when you click away from the Ribbon or onto the worksheet.

*   **Pinning the Ribbon (Making it Stick):** To make the Ribbon permanently visible again after collapsing it:
    *   **Method 1 (Pin Button):**  When the Ribbon is temporarily displayed after clicking a tab (while collapsed), click on the **pin icon** (looks like a pushpin) that appears on the right side of the Ribbon.
    *   **Method 2 (Shortcut):** Use the shortcut key **Ctrl + F1** again. This toggles the Ribbon between collapsed and pinned states.

**The File Tab: Backstage View**

*   **File Tab Difference:** The **"File"** tab is distinct from the other tabs in the Ribbon.
*   **Backstage View:** Clicking the "File" tab takes you to the **"Backstage view"** of Excel.
*   **Backstage View Functions:** This view provides access to file-related operations and information:
    *   **File Information:** View details about the current workbook.
    *   **Save As (PDF):** Save the workbook in different formats, including PDF.
    *   **Print:** Print the spreadsheet.
    *   **Account Information:** Check your Excel version and account details.
    *   ... (and other file management options)

*   **Returning to Normal View:** To exit the Backstage view and return to the normal spreadsheet view:
    *   Click the **back arrow** button (typically located in the top-left corner of the Backstage view).
    *   Press the **Escape (Esc)** key.

**Data Input Shortcuts and Techniques**

*   **Example Data Set:**  The tutorial uses an example of "Headcount by Department" data for different months to demonstrate data input techniques.
*   **Title Input:** Type in a title for your data, such as "Headcount by Department", and press **Enter**.
*   **Moving Between Cells During Input:**
    *   **Tab Key:** Pressing **Tab** moves the active cell to the **right** (to the next column).
    *   **Enter Key (Default):** Pressing **Enter** moves the active cell **down** (to the cell below).
    *   **Control + Enter:** Pressing **Ctrl + Enter** confirms the input in the current cell but **keeps the active cell in the same location.**

*   **AutoFill for Series (Months Example):** Excel can automatically recognize and extend certain series, like months, days of the week, and numbers.
    *   **Example - Months:**
        1.  Type "Jan" (or "January") in a cell.
        2.  Select the cell.
        3.  Use the **fill handle** (black plus sign) to drag to the right. Excel will automatically fill in the subsequent months (Feb, Mar, Apr, etc.).
        4.  You will see a small tooltip as you drag, indicating the month that will be filled in.

*   **Editing Cell Content (F2 Key):**
    *   **Edit Mode:** To edit existing content within a cell without completely replacing it, select the cell and press the **F2 key**.
    *   **Cursor Position:** This puts the cell into "edit mode" and places the cursor at the **end of the existing text**. You can then add to or modify the text.
    *   **Replacing Content (Direct Typing):** If you select a cell and immediately start typing, the existing content will be **replaced** entirely.

*   **Fill Right Shortcut (Ctrl + R):**
    *   **Purpose:** To quickly copy the content of the leftmost cell in a selected range to the cells to its right within the same row.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Select the cell(s) containing the value or formula you want to copy to the right.
        2.  Extend the selection to include the cells to the right where you want to fill the content.
        3.  Press **Ctrl + R**. The content from the leftmost cell(s) will be copied to the right.

*   **Data Input within a Selected Range (Tab and Enter Behavior):**
    *   **Benefit:** Selecting a range *before* starting to input data changes the behavior of the Tab and Enter keys, making data entry within a defined area more efficient.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Highlight the range of cells where you plan to enter data.
        2.  Start typing data into the first cell of the selected range.
        3.  Press **Tab** to move to the next cell *within the selected range* in the current row. When you reach the end of the row in the selected range and press Tab again, it will jump to the *first cell of the next row within the selected range*.
        4.  Press **Enter** to move to the first cell in the next row of the selected range (in the same column as the starting cell of the range).
        5.  Continue inputting data. The Tab and Enter keys will cycle through the selected range.
    *   **Exiting the Selected Range:** To stop data input within the selected range and move out of it, either:
        *   Click on a cell outside the selected range.
        *   Use the arrow keys to move the active cell outside the selected range.

**Formatting Data: Enhancing Presentation**

*   **Centering Title Across Columns (Merge & Center):**
    *   **Purpose:** To center a title or heading across multiple columns above your data.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Select the range of cells across which you want to center the title (e.g., cells spanning the width of your data table).
        2.  Go to the **"Home"** tab on the Ribbon.
        3.  In the **"Alignment"** group, click on **"Merge & Center"**.
        *   This will merge the selected cells into a single cell and center the content within it.

*   **Applying Bold Formatting:**
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Select the cell(s) or range you want to format as bold.
        2.  Go to the **"Home"** tab.
        3.  In the **"Font"** group, click on the **"Bold" (B) button**.

*   **Adjusting Column Width to Fit Content (Auto-Fit Multiple Columns):**
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Select the column headers of all the columns you want to auto-fit. You can select multiple columns by clicking and dragging across the column letters.
        2.  Hover the mouse cursor over the vertical line between any two selected column letters.
        3.  **Double-click**. All selected columns will automatically adjust their widths to fit their content.

*   **Adding Borders:**
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Select the cell(s) or range where you want to add borders.
        2.  Go to the **"Home"** tab.
        3.  In the **"Font"** group, click on the dropdown arrow next to the **"Borders"** button (it looks like a windowpane).
        4.  Choose the desired border style from the dropdown menu (e.g., "Bottom Border", "Thick Bottom Border", "All Borders", etc.).

*   **Moving Rows (Inserting Cut Cells with Shift Key):**
    *   **Scenario:** Moving a row (e.g., "HR" row) to a different position within the data (e.g., between "Marketing" and "Sales").
    *   **Using Move Handle with Shift Key:**
        1.  Select the row you want to move (e.g., by clicking on the row number).
        2.  Hover over the border of the selected row until the **move handle** (four-headed arrow) appears.
        3.  **Press and hold the Shift key**.
        4.  Click and drag the row to the desired new position. As you drag with the Shift key held, a dark horizontal line will indicate where the row will be inserted.
        5.  Release the mouse button (and then the Shift key) to insert the row at the indicated position.
    *   **Using Cut and Insert Cut Cells:**
        1.  Select the row to move.
        2.  **Cut** the row: Right-click on the selected row and choose **"Cut"** (or use shortcut **Ctrl + X**).
        3.  Select the row *below* where you want to insert the cut row.
        4.  Right-click on the selected row and choose **"Insert Cut Cells"**.
        *   This will insert the cut row above the currently selected row, shifting existing rows down.

*   **Applying Cell Formatting with Format Painter:**
    *   **Purpose:** To quickly copy formatting (font, color, borders, etc.) from one cell or range to another.
    *   **Using Format Painter (Single Application):**
        1.  Select the cell that has the formatting you want to copy.
        2.  On the **"Home"** tab, in the **"Clipboard"** group, click the **"Format Painter"** button (looks like a paintbrush).
        3.  Click on the cell(s) or range where you want to apply the copied formatting. The formatting will be applied once, and the Format Painter will turn off.
    *   **Using Format Painter (Multiple Applications):**
        1.  Select the cell with the formatting to copy.
        2.  **Double-click** the **"Format Painter"** button.
        3.  Click on each cell or range where you want to apply the formatting. You can apply the formatting to multiple locations. The Format Painter will remain active until you turn it off.
        4.  To turn off the Format Painter, press the **Escape (Esc)** key or click the **"Format Painter"** button again.

        2.  Go to the **"Home"** tab.
        3.  In the **"Font"** group, click on the dropdown arrow next to the **"Fill Color"** button (looks like a paint bucket).
        4.  Choose a color from the color palette.

**Summation (AutoSum and Alt+= Shortcut)**

*   **AutoSum Feature:** Excel's AutoSum feature automatically inserts a SUM formula to quickly calculate the sum of a range of numbers.
    *   **Accessing AutoSum (Ribbon):**
        1.  Select the cell where you want the sum to appear (typically below or to the right of the numbers you want to sum).
        2.  Go to the **"Home"** tab.
        3.  In the **"Editing"** group (usually on the far right), click on the **"AutoSum"** button (it looks like a Greek Sigma symbol Σ).
        *   Excel will automatically attempt to identify the range of numbers to sum (usually the numbers immediately above or to the left of the selected cell). It will insert a SUM formula referencing that range.
        4.  Review the suggested range in the formula bar. If it is correct, press **Enter** to accept the formula and calculate the sum. If the range is incorrect, you can adjust it by dragging to select the correct range before pressing Enter.

*   **AutoSum Shortcut (Alt + =):**

    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Select the cell where you want the sum.
        2.  Press **Alt + =** (hold down the Alt key and press the equals key).
        3.  Excel will automatically insert a SUM formula and suggest a range.
        4.  Press **Enter** to accept and calculate the sum, or adjust the range if needed and then press Enter.

*   **Filling Sum Formulas (Copying Formulas):** After creating a sum formula in one cell, you can use the **fill handle** (black plus sign) to drag the formula to adjacent cells (e.g., to calculate sums for other columns or rows). Excel will automatically adjust the cell references in the copied formulas relative to their new positions, ensuring they sum the correct ranges.

*   **Summing Multiple Columns/Rows at Once:** To sum multiple columns or rows simultaneously:
    1.  Select the range of cells where you want the sums to appear (e.g., an entire row below your data table, or an entire column to the right).
    2.  Press **Alt + =**. Excel will insert SUM formulas in all selected cells, each summing the appropriate range of numbers in its respective column or row.

**Excel Cell Referencing: Absolute, Relative, and Mixed - A Comprehensive Guide**

**Video Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRu48zy-Djk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRu48zy-Djk)

**Introduction**

In this guide, we'll explore the essential concepts of **Absolute, Relative, and Mixed cell referencing** in Excel. Understanding these referencing types is crucial for building dynamic and accurate spreadsheets. We'll use a sample dataset of app sales information across different quarters to illustrate these concepts practically.

**1. Relative Referencing: Understanding the Basics**

Let's start with a common task: calculating the total yearly sales for each app type.

*   **Objective:** Calculate the total sales for each app (Game, Utility, Social) across all four quarters.
*   **Action:** Go to the cell designated for the first app's total (Game app).
*   **Using the SUM Formula:**
    *   Utilize the shortcut key **Alt + = (Equals sign)**.
    *   Excel intelligently inserts the **SUM formula**, automatically recognizing and selecting the numerical values in the adjacent cells (quarters 1 through 4 for the Game app).
    *   Confirm the selected range (e.g., `B5:E5` for the first app) and press **Enter**.
*   **Applying the Formula to Other Rows:**
    *   To apply the same formula to the Utility and Social app rows, simply **double-click the fill handle** (the small square at the bottom-right corner of the selected cell) and drag it down.
*   **Observing Relative Referencing in Action:**
    *   Examine the formulas in each row.
    *   For the first row (Game app), the formula sums `B5:E5`.
    *   For the last row (Social app), the formula automatically adjusts to sum `B7:E7`.
    *   **Explanation:** This automatic adjustment is **Relative Referencing**. As you copy or drag the formula down, the cell references within the formula change relative to their new row position. The row numbers in the formula increase as you move down the rows.

**2. Absolute Referencing: Fixing Cell References**

Now, let's tackle a scenario where we need to calculate percentages based on a fixed total.

*   **Scenario:** Your boss requests the percentage contribution of each app's yearly total to the overall grand total of all apps.
*   **Step 1: Calculate the Grand Total:**
    *   Go to the cell intended for the grand total.
    *   Use the shortcut key **Alt + = (Equals sign)** again.
    *   Excel smartly selects the yearly totals calculated in the previous step and proposes to sum them.
    *   Press **Enter** to calculate the grand total.
*   **Step 2: Calculate Percentages (Initial Attempt - Incorrect):**
    *   In the cell for the percentage of the Game app, start the formula with **= (Equals sign)**.
    *   Click on the Game app's yearly total and then type ** / (Division symbol)**.
    *   Click on the grand total cell.
    *   Change the cell format to **Percentage** if needed.
    *   Attempt to **drag the fill handle down** to apply the formula to other apps.
*   **Identifying the Problem:**
    *   Upon dragging down, you'll notice errors or incorrect percentages.
    *   Examine the formula in the second row (Utility app percentage). It shows the Utility app's total being divided by a cell *below* the intended grand total.
    *   **Reason:** Relative referencing is causing the grand total cell reference to shift down as the formula is copied down. We need the grand total reference to remain constant.
*   **Introducing Absolute Referencing:**
    *   To fix the grand total cell reference, we use **Absolute Referencing**.
    *   **Action:** In the *first* percentage formula (for the Game app), go to the grand total cell reference in the formula bar.
    *   Press the **F4 key**.
    *   **Shortcut Key F4:** This shortcut key adds dollar signs ($) before both the column letter and row number of the cell reference (e.g., `$F$9`).
    *   **Dollar Signs ($):** These dollar signs "fix" or "absolutize" the reference.
        *   `$` before the column letter (e.g., `$F`) fixes the column.
        *   `$` before the row number (e.g., `$9`) fixes the row.
        *   `$F$9` means both the column 'F' and row '9' are fixed.
    *   **Alternative to F4:** You can manually type in the dollar signs if preferred.
*   **Applying Absolute Referencing and Correcting the Formula:**
    *   After adding `$F$9` (or similar absolute reference to your grand total cell) in the first percentage formula, press **Enter**.
    *   Now, **drag the fill handle down** again.
*   **Verifying Absolute Referencing:**
    *   Examine the formulas in subsequent rows.
    *   You'll observe that the first part of the formula (app total) changes relatively, but the second part (grand total) remains fixed at `$F$9` (or your equivalent absolute reference).
    *   **Result:** The percentages are now calculated correctly, each app's total divided by the *same* grand total cell.

**3. Mixed Referencing: Partial Fixation**

Let's explore a more complex scenario where we need to calculate percentages based on quarter totals *within* each app type.

*   **Scenario:** Your boss now wants to see the percentage contribution of each quarter's sales to the *total sales for that specific quarter across all apps*. This will help identify the strongest and weakest quarters for each app.
*   **Preparation:**
    *   Copy the original quarterly sales data (including app names and quarter labels).
    *   Paste this copied data to a new location in your spreadsheet.
    *   Remove the previously calculated percentage values from this new data section, leaving only the original sales figures.
*   **Objective:** Calculate the percentage of each app's sales in a quarter relative to the total sales for *that specific quarter*.
*   **Initial Formula (Incorrect - Using Relative Referencing):**
    *   In the first percentage cell (for Game app in Quarter 1), start with **= (Equals sign)**.
    *   Click on the Game app's Quarter 1 sales figure.
    *   Type ** / (Division symbol)**.
    *   Click on the total sales for Quarter 1 (calculated previously).
    *   Format as **Percentage**.
    *   Attempt to **drag the fill handle to the right** (to apply to other quarters) and then **down** (to apply to other apps).
*   **Identifying the Issue:**
    *   Dragging the formula right and down leads to incorrect percentages.
    *   For example, checking a cell further to the right reveals that both parts of the formula's references have shifted incorrectly due to relative referencing.
*   **Considering Absolute Referencing (And Why It's Not Entirely Right):**
    *   If you were to use *full* absolute referencing (using **F4** on the denominator cell - the quarter total), it would fix the denominator completely.
    *   **Problem:** While it might work correctly when you drag down, it would be wrong when you drag *across* to the next quarter. The denominator would still be fixed to the *first* quarter's total, not the *current* quarter's total.
*   **Introducing Mixed Referencing:**
    *   We need a reference that's *partially* fixed – fixed in one dimension (column or row) but relative in the other. This is **Mixed Referencing**.
    *   **Analysis of Requirements:**
        *   When moving the formula *across* columns (to different quarters), we want the column reference of the denominator (quarter total) to *change* so it refers to the total of the *current* quarter.  So, the column reference should be *relative*.
        *   However, when moving the formula *down* rows (to different apps within the same quarter), we want the *row* reference of the denominator (quarter total) to remain *fixed* to the row containing the quarter totals. So, the row reference should be *absolute*.
    *   **Applying Mixed Referencing:**
        *   In the *first* percentage formula (Game app, Quarter 1), edit the denominator cell reference.
        *   Press **F4 repeatedly** until you achieve a mixed reference where the **column is relative and the row is absolute**.  This will look like `F$5` (assuming F5 is your quarter total cell, adjust row number accordingly).
        *   **Understanding `F$5`:**
            *   `F` (no `$`) - Column 'F' is *relative*. When you drag right, 'F' will change to 'G', 'H', etc.
            *   `$5` - Row '5' is *absolute*. When you drag down, '5' will *always* remain '5'.
*   **Testing and Verification:**
    *   After changing the denominator to `F$5` (or your equivalent mixed reference), press **Enter**.
    *   **Drag the fill handle to the right** across all quarters.
    *   Then, **drag the fill handle down** for all apps.
    *   **Crucial Verification:**
        *   Go to a cell at the bottom-right corner of your percentage table (e.g., Social app, Quarter 4 percentage).
        *   **Double-click inside the cell to inspect the formula.**
        *   **Check:** Does the formula correctly divide the Social app's Quarter 4 sales by the *total for Quarter 4*?
        *   If it does, your mixed referencing is set up correctly.
    *   **Further Check:** Verify that the percentages for each quarter column add up to 100% (or very close due to potential rounding). This is a good indicator that your quarter total denominators are being used correctly.

**4. Quick Tip Recap - F4 Key Functionality**

The **F4 key** is a toggle shortcut for cycling through different referencing types:

*   **Press F4 once:**  `$Column$Row` (**Absolute Referencing**) - Fixes both column and row.
*   **Press F4 twice:** `Column$Row` (**Mixed Referencing - Row Absolute**) - Fixes only the row.
*   **Press F4 three times:** `$ColumnRow` (**Mixed Referencing - Column Absolute**) - Fixes only the column.
*   **Press F4 four times:** `ColumnRow` (**Relative Referencing**) - No fixation, both column and row are relative.

**Conclusion**

Mastering Absolute, Relative, and Mixed cell referencing is fundamental to efficient and accurate spreadsheet creation in Excel. By understanding when and how to use each type, you can build powerful, dynamic models and analyses. Remember to always test and verify your formulas, especially when using mixed referencing, to ensure they behave as intended across your dataset.

**Title: Understanding Excel Cell Modes: Ready, Enter, Point, and Edit**

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgXiepZUumc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgXiepZUumc)

**(Introduction)**

Have you ever noticed that **Excel** behaves differently depending on what you're doing?  I recently discovered **Excel's cell modes**, and it was a real eye-opener!  It turns out that **Excel** operates in different modes, especially when you're working within dialog boxes.

For instance, if you're in a **data validation dialog box** and try to use your keyboard arrow keys to navigate, **Excel** automatically inserts cell references into the dialog box. This happens because you are in **point mode**, which is distinct from **edit mode**.

So, what exactly are these **cell modes** in **Excel**, and how do we switch between them? Let's explore this together!

**(Upbeat music)**

---

**1. Ready Mode: The Default State**

*   The **default cell mode** in **Excel**, or what we can call the "normal state," is **ready mode**.
*   You can always identify **ready mode** by looking at the bottom left-hand side of your **Excel** window, where it is displayed.
*   In **ready mode**:
    *   You can click on cells.
    *   You can move around the worksheet.
    *   You can interact with dialog boxes.
    *   **Excel** remains in **ready mode** while performing these actions.

---

**2. Enter Mode: Inputting Data**

*   **Enter mode** is activated as soon as you begin typing something into a cell.
*   **Example 1: Number Input**
    *   If you start typing a number (e.g., "50") without beginning with an equal sign (=), plus sign (+), or minus sign (-), **Excel** enters **enter mode**.
    *   In this scenario, **Excel** assumes you are inputting a value, not a formula.
    *   Using arrow keys in **enter mode** (when inputting a number) will:
        *   Finalize the number input in the current cell.
        *   Move to the next cell in the direction of the arrow key.
        *   For example, typing "50" and pressing the down arrow key will enter "50" in the cell and move the selection down one cell.

*   **Example 2: Formula Input (Initial Stage)**
    *   If you start typing with an equal sign (=), plus sign (+), or minus sign (-), **Excel** also enters **enter mode** initially.
    *   **Excel** recognizes that you are starting to input a formula.

---

**3. Point Mode: Referencing Cells in Formulas**

*   **Transition from Enter Mode to Point Mode:**
    *   When you are in **enter mode** and have started a formula (by typing =, +, or -), using the arrow keys will automatically switch you to **point mode**.
    *   This is because **Excel** anticipates that you want to use the arrow keys to select cells to reference in your formula.

*   **Example of Point Mode in Action:**
    1.  Start typing a formula with an equal sign (=). **Excel** enters **enter mode**.
    2.  Use the arrow keys to move around the worksheet.
    3.  **Excel** instantly switches to **point mode**.
    4.  As you move with the arrow keys, **Excel** creates cell references in your formula.
    5.  For instance, if you type `= ` and then use the up arrow key to select cell A1, your formula will become `=A1`.

*   **Continuing to Build a Formula in Point Mode:**
    1.  After referencing a cell in **point mode**, you can continue building your formula.
    2.  For example, after `=A1`, you can type a plus sign (+) and use the arrow keys again to select another cell (e.g., B2). This will extend your formula to `=A1+B2`.
    3.  Pressing **Enter** will finalize the formula, and **Excel** will return to **ready mode**.

---

**4. Edit Mode: Modifying Cell Content**

*   **Entering Edit Mode:**
    *   To modify the content of a cell that already contains data (number, text, or formula), you need to enter **edit mode**.
    *   You can enter **edit mode** in two ways:
        *   **Using the F2 shortcut key.**
        *   **Double-clicking inside the cell.**
    *   Once in **edit mode**, the status bar at the bottom left will indicate "Edit".

*   **Functionality in Edit Mode:**
    *   In **edit mode**, the arrow keys behave differently compared to **enter** or **point mode**.
    *   Arrow keys are used to navigate *within* the cell's content (formula or text), not to move to different cells.
    *   You can move the cursor left, right, up, or down *inside* the cell to make changes to the existing content.

*   **Switching Between Edit and Point/Enter Modes when Editing Formulas:**
    *   Let's say you are in **edit mode** modifying a formula, and you want to reference a different cell using arrow keys.
    *   Directly pressing arrow keys from **edit mode** will only move the cursor within the formula, not select other cells.
    *   To switch back to **point mode** from **edit mode** to select cells using arrow keys, you need to press the **F2 key** again.
    *   Pressing **F2** while in **edit mode** will toggle you back to **enter mode** (specifically, in the context of formula editing, it will behave like point mode for cell selection).
    *   From this **enter mode** (after pressing **F2** from edit mode), you can now use arrow keys to select cells and create references in your formula (i.e., you're effectively in point mode).
    *   To return to **edit mode** and continue modifying the formula text itself (not cell references), press **F2** again.

*   **Example Scenario: Editing a Formula and Switching Modes:**
    1.  Assume cell A1 contains the formula `=B1+C1`.
    2.  Select cell A1 and press **F2** to enter **edit mode**.
    3.  To change `C1` to `D1` by selecting cell D1 with arrow keys:
        *   Press **F2** again while in edit mode. This switches you to **enter mode** (and effectively point mode).
        *   Use arrow keys to navigate to cell D1. Cell D1 will be inserted into your formula.
        *   Press **Enter** to finalize the formula.
    4.  If you simply wanted to edit the `+` to a `-` in the original formula `=B1+C1`:
        *   Enter **edit mode** (F2 or double-click).
        *   Use left/right arrow keys to move within the formula and change `+` to `-`.

---

**5. Cell Modes in Dialog Boxes (Data Validation, Conditional Formatting, etc.)**

*   **The Frustration Factor:**  Working with dialog boxes like **conditional formatting**, **data validation**, **name manager** in formulas, or even adjusting **chart ranges** can be confusing because of cell modes.

*   **Example: Conditional Formatting Rule Dialog Box**
    1.  Consider a conditional formatting rule that checks if cell **F5** is less than **G5** and formats **F5** orange if true.
    2.  Open the "Edit Rule" dialog box for this rule.
    3.  If you try to use arrow keys to adjust the cell reference (e.g., change `F5` to `F6`) directly in the dialog box:
        *   **Excel** will likely enter **point mode** (or enter mode behaving like point mode in this context).
        *   Instead of editing `F5`, **Excel** will interpret your arrow key press as an attempt to select a new cell reference and will start building a new reference in the formula field, often starting with an equal sign.

*   **Solution: Using F2 in Dialog Boxes**
    *   To edit cell references *within* dialog boxes without accidentally entering **point mode** when you intend to edit existing text:
        *   **Immediately after opening a dialog box where you need to edit cell references, press the F2 key.**
        *   This will force **Excel** into **edit mode** *within the dialog box field*.
        *   Now, you can use arrow keys to move within the existing cell reference text and make edits (like changing row or column numbers, or deleting dollar signs for relative references).

*   **Example Revisited: Conditional Formatting Rule Adjustment**
    1.  Open the "Edit Rule" dialog for the conditional formatting rule.
    2.  **Before** using arrow keys, press **F2**. You are now in **edit mode** within the formula field.
    3.  Use arrow keys to navigate within `F5` and change it to `F6`, for example, or delete a dollar sign.
    4.  If you then decide you *do* want to reference a different cell entirely:
        *   From **edit mode**, press **F2** again. This will put you into **enter mode** (functioning as point mode).
        *   Now, using arrow keys will allow you to select a new cell reference.

*   **Data Validation List Example:**
    *   When creating a data validation list that references a range of cells, the same principle applies.
    *   If you want to adjust the referenced range in the data validation dialog box:
        *   Press **F2** to enter **edit mode** before using arrow keys to modify the range text.

*   **Key Takeaway for Dialog Boxes:** To avoid unwanted **point mode** activation in dialog boxes when you intend to edit existing cell references, always remember to press **F2** to enter **edit mode** first.

---

**6. Status Bar: Monitoring Cell Modes**

*   **Importance of the Status Bar:**  The status bar at the bottom left of the **Excel** window is crucial for identifying the current **cell mode**.
*   **Enabling/Disabling the Status Bar Cell Mode Indicator:**
    *   If you don't see the cell mode indicator in your status bar, it might be disabled.
    *   To toggle the cell mode indicator on or off:
        1.  **Right-click** anywhere on the status bar.
        2.  In the context menu that appears, look for "**Cell Mode**" (it's usually near the top).
        3.  Click on "**Cell Mode**" to toggle its visibility.
        4.  If it's checked, the cell mode indicator will be visible. If unchecked, it will be hidden.

*   **Recommendation:** Keep the "Cell Mode" indicator enabled in your status bar to always be aware of the current **Excel** cell mode. This helps in understanding **Excel's** behavior and avoiding confusion.

---

**(Conclusion)**

Understanding **Excel's cell modes** (**ready, enter, point, and edit**) and how to switch between them is essential for efficient and frustration-free work, especially when dealing with formulas and dialog boxes.  Pay attention to the status bar to see which mode you are in and use the **F2 key** to toggle between **edit mode** and **enter/point mode** as needed, particularly within dialog boxes.

I hope you found this basic explanation helpful! It's a detail that's easy to overlook, but understanding cell modes can significantly improve your **Excel** experience.

**Video Title:** Excel Filter Basics

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMlTDXPEjag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMlTDXPEjag)

**Introduction to Excel Filters**

In today's video, we will explore the fundamentals of **Excel filter options**.  Excel filters are incredibly useful when working with **large data tables**. Due to the extensive range of options available, this topic will be divided into two videos.

*   **This Video (Part 1):** We will cover the **basic filter options**.
*   **Next Video (Part 2):** We will delve into **more advanced filter options**.

**Sample Data and Initial Setup**

We will be using a sample data list that includes the following information:

*   **Channel**
*   **Product**
*   **Date**
*   **Sales Value**

Let's begin by applying a filter to this data.

**Methods to Apply Filters**

There are multiple ways to apply a filter to your data in Excel. Here are three methods:

1.  **Keyboard Shortcut (Fastest Method):**
    *   **Step 1:** Click anywhere within your data set.
    *   **Step 2:** Press **Ctrl + Shift + L**.
    *   This will add filter icons (dropdown arrows) to each column header.
    *   To **clear the filter**, press **Ctrl + Shift + L** again.

2.  **Home Tab Method:**
    *   **Step 1:** Go to the **Home** tab in the Excel ribbon.
    *   **Step 2:** In the **Editing** group, find and click on **Sort & Filter**.
    *   **Step 3:** Select **Filter** from the dropdown menu.
    *   This will also add filter icons to the header row.

3.  **Right-Click Method (Contextual Filtering):**
    *   **Step 1:** Right-click on a cell containing a specific value you want to filter by. For example, if you want to filter for "shirt blue," right-click on a cell containing "shirt blue" in the 'Product' column.
    *   **Step 2:** In the context menu, go to **Filter**.
    *   **Step 3:** Select **Filter by Selected Cell's Value**.
    *   This will immediately filter the data to show only rows that match the selected cell's value.

**Understanding Filtered Data**

When a filter is applied, you'll notice a few visual cues:

*   **Blue Row Numbers:** The row numbers of the visible rows will appear in **blue font**. This indicates that rows are hidden, not deleted.
*   **Status Bar Message:** At the bottom of the Excel window, the status bar will display a message like "Filter gives X out of Y records," showing the number of visible records out of the total records.  For example, "6 out of 26 records" indicates that the filter is currently showing 6 records out of an original 26.

**Making Individual Selections in Filters**

You can customize filters by making individual selections within the filter dropdown menus.

*   **Example: Filtering by Channel (Website and Affiliate Site)**
    *   **Step 1:** Click the filter dropdown arrow in the 'Channel' column.
    *   **Step 2:** **Clear** the "(Select All)" checkbox to deselect all options.
    *   **Step 3:** Check the boxes next to **"affiliate site"** and **"website"**.
    *   **Step 4:** Click **OK**.
    *   The filter will now display only rows where the 'Channel' is either "affiliate site" or "website."

**Using Wildcards in Filters (Text Filters)**

Wildcards can be used in the filter search box for more flexible text filtering. The **asterisk (*) symbol** is used as a wildcard character.

*   **Example: Filtering Products Containing "shirt"**
    *   **Step 1:** Click the filter dropdown arrow in the 'Product' column.
    *   **Step 2:** In the search box, type **`*shirt*`**.
        *   The asterisk before "shirt" means it can be preceded by any characters (e.g., "blue shirt," "white shirt").
        *   The asterisk after "shirt" means it can be followed by any characters (e.g., "shirt size L").
    *   **Step 3:** Observe that Excel automatically selects all items containing "shirt."
    *   **Step 4:** Click **OK**.
    *   The filter will now display only products containing "shirt" anywhere in their name.

*   **Wildcards for other columns (Example: Filtering Channels Containing "site")**
    *   The same wildcard method can be applied to other text-based columns, such as 'Channel'.  Typing **`*site`** in the 'Channel' filter search box will select both "affiliate site" and "website."

**Clearing Filters**

There are several methods to clear filters:

1.  **Clearing Filters Individually (Less Efficient):**
    *   You can manually clear filters from each column by going to the filter dropdown and selecting "Clear Filter From 'Column Name'".  However, this can be time-consuming if multiple filters are applied.

2.  **Home Tab Method (Clear All Filters):**
    *   **Step 1:** Go to the **Home** tab.
    *   **Step 2:** Click on **Sort & Filter**.
    *   **Step 3:** Select **Clear**.
    *   This will remove all filters applied to the data.

3.  **Keyboard Shortcut (Clear and Re-apply - Efficient for Resetting):**
    *   Press **Ctrl + Shift + L** **twice**.
        *   The first press (**Ctrl + Shift + L**) will **remove** all filters.
        *   The second press (**Ctrl + Shift + L**) will **re-apply** the filter functionality (but without any filters actively applied). This effectively clears all filters and resets the filter interface.

**Filtering by Color**

Excel allows filtering based on cell background color.

*   **Example: Filtering by Green Background Color**
    *   **Step 1:** Assume you have manually colored some cells in your data (e.g., some cells in the 'Sales Value' column are highlighted in green and others in yellow).
    *   **Step 2:** Click the filter dropdown arrow in the column you want to filter by color (e.g., 'Sales Value').
    *   **Step 3:** Go to **Filter by Color**.
    *   **Step 4:** Select the desired color from the available color options (Excel automatically detects the colors present in the filtered column). For example, click on the green color if you want to filter by green background.
    *   This will display only the rows where the selected column has cells filled with the chosen color.

**Copying Filtered Results**

To copy only the visible (filtered) rows:

*   **Step 1:** Select all the visible data in the filtered range by pressing **Ctrl + A**.
*   **Step 2:** Copy the selected data by pressing **Ctrl + C**. You will see the "marching ants" border around the filtered rows, indicating only these rows are selected for copying.
*   **Step 3:** Go to a new sheet or location where you want to paste the filtered data.
*   **Step 4:** Paste the copied data by pressing **Ctrl + V**.
*   Only the filtered rows will be pasted; hidden rows are not included in the copy.
*   Press **Esc** to remove the "marching ants" selection border.

**Date Filters**

Excel provides specialized date filters for working with date columns.

*   **Accessing Date Filters:** Click the filter dropdown arrow in a column containing dates. You will see options like "Date Filters" with pre-defined date ranges.

*   **Common Date Filter Options:**
    *   **"This Month"**: Filters data for the current month. (Example in video: February data when recording in February).
    *   **"Last Month"**: Filters data for the previous month.
    *   **"Year to date"**: Filters data from the beginning of the current year up to the current date. (Example in video: January and February data).
    *   **"Between..."**: Opens the **Custom AutoFilter** dialog box to specify a date range between two dates.

*   **"Between..." Date Filter Example:**
    *   **Step 1:** Select "Between..." from the Date Filters menu.
    *   **Step 2:** In the **Custom AutoFilter** dialog, you can set a date range.  Excel provides a date picker calendar, so you don't need to worry about date formats.
    *   **Step 3:** Set the "is after or equal to" date (e.g., January 10th).
    *   **Step 4:** Set the "and is before or equal to" date (e.g., February 15th). The "and" condition is pre-selected for "between" filters.
    *   **Step 5:** Click **OK**.
    *   This will filter data within the specified date range (inclusive of the start and end dates).

**Using "OR" Conditions in Text Filters (Custom Filter)**

You can create more complex filters using "OR" conditions in custom text filters.

*   **Example: Filtering Products for "blue" OR "white"**
    *   **Step 1:** Click the filter dropdown arrow in the 'Product' column.
    *   **Step 2:** Go to **Text Filters** and select **Custom Filter**.
    *   **Step 3:** In the **Custom AutoFilter** dialog:
        *   In the first dropdown, ensure it is set to "contains".
        *   In the first text box, type **`blue`**.
        *   Select the **"Or"** radio button.
        *   In the second dropdown (below "Or"), ensure it is set to "contains".
        *   In the second text box, type **`white`**.
    *   **Step 4:** Click **OK**.
    *   This will filter the data to show rows where the 'Product' contains either "blue" or "white".

**Calculating Totals on Filtered Data (Subtotal Function)**

Standard SUM function includes hidden rows in calculations.  To calculate totals only on visible (filtered) rows, use the **SUBTOTAL** function.

*   **Problem with SUM Function:**
    *   Using the regular `SUM` function on a range that includes filtered data will sum **all** cells in the range, including hidden rows. This is often not desired when you want the sum of only the visible data.

*   **Solution: SUBTOTAL Function**
    *   The `SUBTOTAL` function is designed to work with filtered data and can exclude hidden rows from calculations.
    *   **Syntax:** `SUBTOTAL(function_num, ref1, [ref2], ...)`
        *   `function_num`:  Specifies the type of calculation. Use **`9`** for **SUM**.
        *   `ref1`: The range you want to subtotal.
    *   **Example: `=SUBTOTAL(9, A5:A30)`** (Assuming sales values are in column A from row 5 to 30).
    *   This formula will sum only the visible cells within the range `A5:A30` after a filter is applied.

**Benefits of Using Excel Tables**

Converting your data range into an **Excel Table** offers significant advantages, including enhanced filtering capabilities and more.

*   **Creating an Excel Table:**
    *   **Method 1: Keyboard Shortcut (Fastest)**
        *   **Step 1:** Click anywhere within your data set.
        *   **Step 2:** Press **Ctrl + T**.
        *   **Step 3:** In the "Create Table" dialog, confirm that the selected range is correct and that "My table has headers" is checked (if your data has headers).
        *   **Step 4:** Click **OK**.
    *   **Method 2: Insert Tab**
        *   **Step 1:** Go to the **Insert** tab.
        *   **Step 2:** Click on **Table**. (If your data is already in a table, the "Table" option will be deactivated).
        *   **Step 3:** In the "Create Table" dialog, confirm the range and headers as above, and click **OK**.

*   **Table Design Tab:** Once a table is created, a new tab called **Table Design** becomes available in the ribbon, providing table-specific options.

*   **Table Styles:** Tables are automatically formatted with a default style. You can change or remove the style:
    *   In the **Table Styles** group on the **Table Design** tab, you can select different styles or choose "None" to remove styling and revert to a plain look.

*   **Total Row Feature (Tables):** Tables simplify adding totals that automatically adjust to filters.
    *   **Step 1:** On the **Table Design** tab, in the **Table Style Options** group, check the **Total Row** checkbox.
    *   A total row will appear at the bottom of the table.
    *   **Step 2:** In the total row cells, you can select the type of calculation you want from a dropdown menu (e.g., Sum, Average, Count, etc.).
    *   These totals automatically recalculate based on the applied filters.

*   **Dynamic Data Range:** Tables dynamically expand as you add more data. Formulas, charts, and pivot tables referencing the table automatically update to include new data rows. This is a major advantage over using regular data ranges.

**Next Steps: Advanced Filters**

In the **next video**, we will explore **Advanced Filters**.

*   **Location of Advanced Filter:**  Advanced Filter is located on the **Data** tab, in the **Sort & Filter** group, under the **Advanced** option.
*   Advanced Filters offer more complex filtering criteria and options compared to basic filters.  We will explore the benefits of Advanced Filters in detail in the next tutorial.

**Lecture: Advanced Excel Filter Options**

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqQACB_69SQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqQACB_69SQ)

**Introduction to Advanced Filters**

In this lecture, we will explore **Advanced Excel Filter Options**. We will be using a sample dataset, similar to what we used when we learned how to apply a quick filter using the shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+L**.

While the normal filter (applied with **Ctrl+Shift+L**) is useful, it has a limitation:

*   **Limited Visibility of Filter Criteria:**  With a normal filter, you only see the applied filters when you hover your mouse over the filter icon. This can be inconvenient when you need to quickly understand the active filters. For example, if filters are applied to "Channel" and "Product", you must hover to see that "Channel" is filtered to "Store" and "Product" is filtered to "Pants Black-Pants Blue".

**Why Use Advanced Filter?**

If you need **full control and clear visibility** of your filter criteria, the **Advanced Filter** is the better option.

*   **Explicit Criteria Definition:**  Advanced Filter requires you to specify your filter criteria in separate cells on your worksheet. This makes your filter conditions **clearly visible and easily understandable**.

**Accessing the Advanced Filter**

To access the Advanced Filter dialog box:

1.  Go to the **Data** tab in the Excel ribbon.
2.  In the **Sort & Filter** group, click on **Advanced**.

**Advanced Filter Dialog Box Options**

Upon opening the Advanced Filter dialog box, you will see several options:

*   **Action:**
    *   **Filter the list, in-place:** This option filters the original dataset directly, hiding rows that do not meet the criteria. This is similar to how the normal filter works.
    *   **Copy to another location:** This option allows you to copy the filtered results to a different location on the worksheet, leaving the original dataset unchanged.
*   **List range:** This field defines the range of data you want to filter. Excel is usually smart enough to automatically select the correct range based on your current selection.
*   **Criteria range:** This is the crucial part of Advanced Filter. You define your filter conditions in cells on your worksheet, and then specify the range of these cells as the "Criteria range".
*   **Unique records only:** This checkbox allows you to extract only the unique records from your dataset based on the specified criteria (or from the entire dataset if no criteria are specified). We will explore this option later in the lecture.

**Basic Filtering Using Criteria Range**

Let's demonstrate basic filtering using the Criteria Range. Suppose we want to filter the data to show only records where the **Channel** is "Store".

1.  **Prepare the Criteria Range:**
    *   First, **unfilter** any existing filters by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+L**.
    *   In empty cells on your worksheet, you need to set up your criteria.  **Start by entering the Header of the column you want to filter**. In this case, the header for the "Channel" column is "Channel". You can either type it or copy it from the dataset headers. **Note:** Criteria headers are **not case-sensitive**.
    *   In the cell **directly below** the header "Channel", type the criteria value, which is "Store".

2.  **Apply Advanced Filter:**
    *   Go to **Data** > **Advanced**.
    *   Ensure **"Filter the list, in-place"** is selected.
    *   The **"List range"** should automatically be selected correctly. Verify it includes your entire dataset.
    *   In the **"Criteria range"** field, select the cells containing your criteria, **including the header cell ("Channel") and the criteria value ("Store")**.
    *   Click **"OK"**.

The list will now be filtered to show only records where the "Channel" is "Store". The advantage here is that **you can clearly see the filter criteria ("Channel" and "Store") in the cells you designated as the Criteria Range.**

**Using AND Conditions in Advanced Filter**

Advanced Filter allows you to use **AND** and **OR** conditions to create more complex filters.

To apply an **AND** condition, you place criteria for different columns **in the same row** within the Criteria Range.

Let's filter for records where **Channel is "Store" AND Product is "Pants Blue"**.

1.  **Prepare the Criteria Range for AND Condition:**
    *   In the Criteria Range you've already set up (with "Channel" and "Store"), add another header **beside** "Channel". This header should be for the second column you want to filter, which is "Product". So, enter "Product" in the cell to the right of "Channel".
    *   Under the "Product" header, in the same row as "Store" (under "Channel"), type the second criteria value: "Pants Blue".

    Your Criteria Range now looks like this:

    | Channel | Product     |
    | :------ | :---------- |
    | Store   | Pants Blue  |

2.  **Apply Advanced Filter with AND Condition:**
    *   Go to **Data** > **Advanced**.
    *   Ensure **"Filter the list, in-place"** is selected.
    *   Verify the **"List range"** is correct.
    *   **Expand the "Criteria range"** to include both criteria columns (from "Channel" and "Store" to "Product" and "Pants Blue").
    *   Click **"OK"**.

Now, the list is filtered to show only records where **both** "Channel" is "Store" **AND** "Product" is "Pants Blue".

**Using NOT Conditions in Advanced Filter**

You can also use **NOT** conditions in Advanced Filter. To specify "not equal to", use the symbols **"<>"** (less than and greater than signs).

Let's filter for records where **Channel is "Store" AND Product is NOT "Pants Blue"**.

1.  **Modify the Criteria Range for NOT Condition:**
    *   In the Criteria Range from the previous example, change the "Pants Blue" criteria under "Product" to **"<>"Pants Blue"**.

    Your Criteria Range now looks like this:

    | Channel | Product        |
    | :------ | :------------- |
    | Store   | <>Pants Blue   |

2.  **Apply Advanced Filter with NOT Condition:**
    *   Go to **Data** > **Advanced**.
    *   Ensure **"Filter the list, in-place"** is selected.
    *   Verify the **"List range"** is correct.
    *   Ensure the **"Criteria range"** is still set correctly to include both criteria columns.
    *   Click **"OK"**.

The list is now filtered to show records where "Channel" is "Store" and "Product" is anything **except** "Pants Blue".

**Using Wildcards in Advanced Filter**

Advanced Filter supports **wildcards** for more flexible text filtering. The asterisk "**\***" wildcard represents **any sequence of characters**.

Let's filter for records where **Product contains the word "Pants"**.

1.  **Modify the Criteria Range for Wildcards:**
    *   Change the criteria under "Product" to  **"\*Pants\*"**.  The asterisks before and after "Pants" mean that "Pants" can appear anywhere within the Product name.

    Your Criteria Range now looks like this:

    | Channel | Product       |
    | :------ | :------------ |
    | Store   | \*Pants\*     |

2.  **Apply Advanced Filter with Wildcards:**
    *   Go to **Data** > **Advanced**.
    *   Ensure **"Filter the list, in-place"** is selected.
    *   Verify the **"List range"** is correct.
    *   Ensure the **"Criteria range"** is still set correctly.
    *   Click **"OK"**.

The list will now show records where the "Product" name contains the word "Pants", regardless of its position in the name.

**Using OR Conditions in Advanced Filter**

To apply an **OR** condition, you place criteria for different conditions **in separate rows** within the Criteria Range.

Let's filter for records where **(Channel is "Store" AND Product contains "Pants") OR (Channel is "Store" AND Product is "Shirt White")**.

1.  **Prepare the Criteria Range for OR Condition:**
    *   You will need to repeat the "Channel" header in the second row of your criteria range because the "Store" condition applies to both OR clauses.
    *   Set up your Criteria Range like this:

    | Channel | Product       |
    | :------ | :------------ |
    | Store   | \*Pants\*     |
    | Store   | Shirt White   |

    This structure indicates that a record should be included if it meets **either** the criteria in the first row **OR** the criteria in the second row.

2.  **Apply Advanced Filter with OR Condition:**
    *   Go to **Data** > **Advanced**.
    *   Ensure **"Filter the list, in-place"** is selected.
    *   Verify the **"List range"** is correct.
    *   **Update the "Criteria range"** to include all rows and columns of your criteria range (from the first "Channel" to the "Shirt White").
    *   Click **"OK"**.

The list will now show records that satisfy either condition: "Channel" is "Store" AND "Product" contains "Pants", OR "Channel" is "Store" AND "Product" is "Shirt White".

**Combining AND/OR Conditions with Numerical Criteria**

Advanced Filter can also handle numerical criteria and combine them with AND/OR logic.

Let's filter for records where:

*   **(Channel is "Store" AND Product contains "Pants" AND Sales Value is between 200 and 400) OR (Channel is "Store" AND Product is "Shirt White" AND Sales Value is between 200 and 400)**

1.  **Prepare the Criteria Range with Numerical AND/OR Conditions:**
    *   Add a new header "Sales Value" to your Criteria Range.
    *   To represent the "between 200 and 400" condition for both OR clauses, you will need to specify both conditions (greater than 200 AND less than 400) for each row in your OR criteria.
    *   Set up your Criteria Range like this:

    | Channel | Product       | Sales Value | Sales Value |
    | :------ | :------------ | :---------- | :---------- |
    | Store   | \*Pants\*     | >200       | <400       |
    | Store   | Shirt White   | >200       | <400       |

    **Explanation:**  Notice we repeated the "Sales Value" header twice in each row to specify both the "greater than 200" and "less than 400" conditions as **AND** conditions within each row (for each OR clause).

2.  **Apply Advanced Filter with Combined Conditions:**
    *   Go to **Data** > **Advanced**.
    *   Ensure **"Filter the list, in-place"** is selected.
    *   Verify the **"List range"** is correct.
    *   **Update the "Criteria range"** to include the entire criteria range you just set up (from the first "Channel" to the last "<400").
    *   Click **"OK"**.

The list will now be filtered to show only records that meet the complex criteria defined in your Criteria Range.

**Extracting Unique Records to Another Location**

Finally, let's see how to extract **Unique Records** using Advanced Filter.  Suppose we want to get a list of **unique Product names** from the entire dataset.

1.  **Clear Existing Filters:** Ensure any existing filters are cleared (**Ctrl+Shift+L**).
2.  **Prepare for Unique Record Extraction:**
    *   Go to **Data** > **Advanced**.
    *   Select **"Copy to another location"** under "Action".
    *   For **"List range"**, select the entire **"Product" column** (including the header "Product").
    *   **Leave the "Criteria range" field blank** because we want to extract unique records from the entire list without any specific conditions.
    *   Check the **"Unique records only"** checkbox.
    *   In the **"Copy to"** field, select an empty cell on your worksheet where you want the unique list of products to be placed.
    *   Click **"OK"**.

A list of unique product names will be copied to the location you specified.

**Conclusion**

Advanced Filter in Excel provides powerful and flexible filtering capabilities, offering more control and visibility compared to basic filters. You can use **AND**, **OR**, **NOT** conditions, and **wildcards** to create complex filters based on text and numerical data.  You can also easily extract unique records.

Remember:

*   **AND conditions:** Criteria in the same row.
*   **OR conditions:** Criteria in different rows.
*   **Criteria Range:**  Clearly displays your filter conditions.

## **Introduction to Sorting Options in Excel and Maintaining Original Data Order**

Let's explore the various **source options** available for sorting data in Excel. Beyond the standard sorting methods, we will also discuss how to potentially **"unsort"** your data to revert to its original row order.

Excel offers a wide array of sorting capabilities, going beyond simple ascending/descending order for numbers or alphabetical sorting for text. These options include:

*   **Custom Lists:** Define your own specific sort order that Excel should follow.
*   **Multiple Levels:** Sort data based on several criteria, creating hierarchical sorting.
*   **Sorting by Color:** Organize data based on cell or font color.
*   **Sorting by Icon:**  Utilize icons from conditional formatting as a sorting criterion.

Let's delve into practical examples of these sorting techniques and then investigate how to revert to the original, unsorted state.

---

## **Demonstrating Basic Sorting Techniques**

**Sample Dataset:**

We will use a sample dataset containing information on:

*   **Division**
*   **Region**
*   **Apps**
*   **Revenue**

**Sorting by Revenue (Largest to Smallest):**

Suppose we want to quickly identify the app with the highest revenue.

1.  **Click** anywhere within the **"Revenue"** column.
2.  **Right-click** and select **"Sort"**.
3.  Choose **"Largest to Smallest"**.

Excel intelligently recognizes the related data in adjacent columns as part of the same dataset because they are contiguous without gaps.

**Data Range Selection Verification:**

To confirm Excel's selection of the entire dataset:

1.  Click anywhere within the dataset.
2.  Press **`Ctrl + A`**.

You'll see that all related data cells are highlighted, confirming they will be sorted together. Excel is also intelligent enough to identify and exclude the header row from the sorting process.

**Alphabetical Sorting (Division):**

To sort divisions alphabetically:

1.  **Right-click** anywhere within the **"Division"** column.
2.  Go to **"Sort"**.
3.  Select **"A to Z"** (or "Z to A" for reverse alphabetical order).

This will sort the divisions alphabetically (e.g., Game, Productivity, Utility).

---

## **Handling External Data and Selective Sorting**

**Scenario: Preventing Unintended Sorting of External Text**

Consider a situation where you have unrelated text outside your dataset. If this text is adjacent to your dataset without any blank columns or rows, Excel might include it in the sort range by default.

**Demonstration:**

If you have text next to your dataset and you use `Ctrl + A` after clicking within the dataset, the unrelated text will also be selected, indicating it will be included in the sort operation.

**Solution: Selecting Specific Data Range for Sorting**

To prevent unintended sorting of external data, explicitly select only the desired data range before sorting.

1.  **Highlight** the specific data area you want to sort.
    *   Use the shortcut: **`Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow`** to quickly select from the current cell to the bottom of a contiguous data column.
2.  **Right-click** within the selected range.
3.  Go to **"Sort"**.

---

## **Accessing Advanced Sorting Options: Custom Sort**

**Methods to Access "Custom Sort" Dialog:**

*   **Right-Click Method:**
    1.  Right-click within your data range.
    2.  Select **"Sort"**.
    3.  Choose **"Custom Sort..."** at the bottom of the Sort menu.

*   **Home Tab Method:**
    1.  Go to the **"Home"** tab on the Excel ribbon.
    2.  In the **"Editing"** group, find **"Sort & Filter"**.
    3.  Click on **"Sort & Filter"** and select **"Custom Sort..."**.

**"Custom Sort" Dialog Features:**

The "Custom Sort" dialog provides comprehensive control over sorting:

*   **Column Selection:** Choose the column to sort by.
*   **Sort On:** Specify what to sort on (Values, Cell Color, Font Color, Cell Icon).
*   **Order:** Define the sort order (Ascending, Descending, Custom Lists).
*   **"My data has headers" Checkbox:** Ensure headers are correctly identified and excluded from sorting.

**Example: Sorting Revenue (Smallest to Largest) using "Custom Sort":**

1.  Open the **"Custom Sort"** dialog.
2.  In the **"Column"** dropdown, select **"Revenue"**.
3.  Ensure **"Sort On"** is set to **"Values"**.
4.  Choose **"Smallest to Largest"** in the **"Order"** dropdown.
5.  Click **"OK"**.

---

## **Implementing Custom Sort Lists**

**Scenario: Defining a Specific Order for "Division"**

Instead of alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order for "Division," we want a custom order: Productivity, then Utility, and finally Game.

**Steps to Create and Apply a Custom Sort List:**

1.  Open the **"Custom Sort"** dialog (via right-click or Home tab).
2.  Ensure the **"Column"** is set to **"Division"**.
3.  For **"Order,"** select **"Custom List..."**.
4.  In the "Custom Lists" dialog, under "List entries," type your desired order, each item on a new line:
    *   `Productivity`
    *   `Utility`
    *   `Game`
5.  Click **"Add"** to add this list to the "Custom lists."
6.  Select your newly created list in the "Custom lists" section.
7.  Click **"OK"** in the "Custom Lists" dialog.
8.  Click **"OK"** in the "Custom Sort" dialog.

The "Division" column will now be sorted according to your custom list order.

---

## **Utilizing Multi-Level Sorting**

**Scenario: Sorting by Division, then Region, then Apps**

We want to sort the data first by "Division" using our custom list, then within each division, by "Region" alphabetically (A to Z), and finally by "Apps" alphabetically.

**Steps for Multi-Level Sorting:**

1.  Open the **"Custom Sort"** dialog.
2.  **Level 1 (Division):**
    *   "Column": **Division**
    *   "Sort On": **Values**
    *   "Order": *Your Custom Division List*
3.  Click **"Add Level"** to add a second sorting criterion.
4.  **Level 2 (Region):**
    *   "Then by": **Region**
    *   "Sort On": **Values**
    *   "Order": **A to Z**
5.  Click **"Add Level"** again for the third level.
6.  **Level 3 (Apps):**
    *   "Then by": **Apps**
    *   "Sort On": **Values**
    *   "Order": **A to Z**
7.  Click **"OK"**.

The data will now be sorted hierarchically: primarily by Division (custom order), secondarily by Region (A to Z within each Division), and finally by Apps (A to Z within each Region).

---

## **Sorting by Cell Color and Icon**

**Scenario: Prioritizing Highlighted Data**

Assume certain revenue figures are highlighted in **yellow** and **green** to indicate specific attention points. We want to sort these highlighted cells to the top, prioritizing yellow over green, and then maintain the previously defined multi-level sort order.

**Sorting by Cell Color:**

1.  Open the **"Custom Sort"** dialog.
2.  **Add a new Level** at the top (using "Add Level" and then "Move Up" arrows).
3.  **Level 1 (Cell Color - Yellow):**
    *   "Column": **Revenue**
    *   "Sort On": **Cell Color**
    *   "Order": Select **"Yellow"** and choose **"On Top"**.
4.  **Add another Level** below the yellow color sort.
5.  **Level 2 (Cell Color - Green):**
    *   "Column": **Revenue**
    *   "Sort On": **Cell Color**
    *   "Order": Select **"Green"** and choose **"On Top"**.
6.  The subsequent levels (Division, Region, Apps) will remain as previously defined, ensuring the original sort order is maintained after color sorting.
7.  Click **"OK"**.

This will bring all yellow-highlighted cells to the top, followed by green-highlighted cells, and then the remaining data sorted according to the original multi-level criteria.

**Sorting by Conditional Formatting Icons:**

**Adding Conditional Formatting Icons (Example):**

1.  Select the "Revenue" data range.
2.  Go to **"Home"** tab -> **"Conditional Formatting"** -> **"Icon Sets"**.
3.  Choose an icon set (e.g., flags).
4.  (Optional) Customize icon rules in **"Conditional Formatting"** -> **"Manage Rules..."** -> **"Edit Rule..."**.

**Sorting by Cell Icon:**

1.  Open the **"Custom Sort"** dialog.
2.  **Delete existing color-based sort levels** if you want to replace them (select a level and click "Delete Level").
3.  **Add a new Level** for icon sorting.
4.  **Level 1 (Cell Icon - Green Flag):**
    *   "Column": **Revenue**
    *   "Sort On": **Cell Icon**
    *   "Order": Select the **"Green Flag"** icon and choose **"On Top"**.
5.  **Add subsequent levels** for other icons (e.g., Red Flag, Yellow Flag) following the same process, if desired order is specific to icons.
6.  Click **"OK"**.

This will sort the data based on the icons, bringing the specified icon (e.g., green flag) to the top, followed by others as configured.

## **Reverting to Original Sort Order: The "Helper Column" Technique**

**The Problem:**

Once you sort data in Excel, the original row order is lost. Excel does not inherently remember the initial arrangement unless you immediately use `Ctrl + Z` to undo. Saving and reopening the file after sorting will permanently lose the original order.

**The Solution: Adding an Index/Helper Column**

To preserve and restore the original sort order, create an index column *before* performing any sorting operations.

**Steps to Implement the Helper Column:**

1.  **Insert a new column** at the beginning or anywhere within your dataset.
2.  In the first cell of the new column, enter **`1`**.
3.  In the cell below, enter **`2`**.
4.  Select both cells (`1` and `2`).
5.  Drag the fill handle (the small square at the bottom-right of the selection) down to the end of your data rows. This will automatically fill the column with sequential numbers (1, 2, 3, ...).
6.  **This column now represents the original row order.**

**Restoring Original Order:**

After sorting your data by any criteria (revenue, division, color, icons, etc.):

1.  To revert to the original order, simply **sort by your helper/index column**.
2.  **Right-click** within the helper column.
3.  Go to **"Sort"**.
4.  Select **"Smallest to Largest"**.

This will re-sort the data back to its initial arrangement based on the numerical index in the helper column.

**Important Note:**

Adding the helper column is a proactive measure. You must implement it *before* you sort your data for the first time if you anticipate needing to revert to the original order later.

---

## **Conclusion**

These are various powerful methods for sorting data in Excel, ranging from basic to advanced techniques like custom lists, multi-level sorting, and sorting by color and icons. Remember that Excel is not a database and does not inherently retain the original sort order after modifications. To overcome this, utilize the "helper column" method to preserve and restore your dataset's initial arrangement.

**Video Introduction: Dynamic Data Validation in Excel**

Video URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRiFfKb_B_A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRiFfKb_B_A)

This video will go beyond the basic understanding of **Excel's Data Validation** feature. We'll explore how to:

*   Make **Drop-Down List** content dynamic, so new categories automatically appear.
*   Implement validation for specific entry types, such as:
    *   Dates in the future.
    *   Numbers within a defined range.
    *   Input values with a specific number of characters.

---

**Scenario: App Development Company Template**

Imagine you work at the headquarters of an app development company with three divisions:

*   **Game Division**
*   **Productivity Division**
*   **Utility Division**

Your responsibility is to collect project information from each division using a template you've created. This template includes a column for "**Division**".  It's crucial to ensure accurate division names are entered to avoid:

*   Spelling errors (e.g., "games" instead of "Game").
*   Spending excessive time correcting mistakes.

The solution is to use a **Drop-Down List** in the "**Division**" column, allowing users to select from predefined options.

---

**Adding a Basic Drop-Down List using Data Validation**

To add a basic Drop-Down List, follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to the Data Tab:** In Excel's ribbon, go to the "**Data**" tab.
2.  **Access Data Validation:** In the "**Data Tools**" group, click on "**Data Validation**".
3.  **Settings Tab:** In the "**Data Validation**" dialog box, the "**Settings**" tab is selected by default.
    *   Currently, "**Allow: Any value**" is set, meaning Excel accepts any input in the cells. We will change this to add restrictions.
4.  **Choose "List" from "Allow":**  From the "**Allow**" dropdown menu, select "**List**". This option creates a Drop-Down List.
5.  **Source Options:** Under "**Source**", you have options for defining the list items:
    *   **Direct Input (Static List):**  If the divisions are unlikely to change, you can type them directly into the "**Source**" box, separated by commas (or the list separator defined in your Excel settings, often a comma or semicolon).
        *   Example: `Game,Productivity,Utility`
    *   **Cell Referencing (Dynamic List):** For lists that might change, it's better to reference cells containing the division names. This makes the Drop-Down dynamic.

---

**Creating a Static Drop-Down List (Direct Input Example)**

Let's create a static Drop-Down List first:

1.  In the "**Source**" box in "**Data Validation**" dialog, type: `Game,Productivity,Utility`
2.  Click "**OK**".

Now, in the selected cells, you will see a dropdown arrow. Clicking it will display the list:

*   Game
*   Productivity
*   Utility

---

**Creating a Dynamic Drop-Down List using Cell References**

For a dynamic Drop-Down List that updates automatically when the division list changes:

1.  **Prepare Division List in Excel Cells:**  Create a list of divisions in a separate sheet (e.g., "**Master Data**" sheet) in Excel. Let's assume you have the divisions listed in cells A1 to A3 of the "**Master Data**" sheet:
    *   **Master Data Sheet:**
        *   A1: Game
        *   A2: Productivity
        *   A3: Utility
2.  **Go back to Data Validation Settings:**  Select the cells where you want the Drop-Down List and open the "**Data Validation**" dialog again.
3.  **Select "List" and Set Source to Cell Range:**
    *   Choose "**List**" under "**Allow**".
    *   In the "**Source**" box, type `=` and then navigate to the "**Master Data**" sheet.
    *   Highlight the range containing the division names (e.g., `Master!A1:A3`).  Excel will automatically populate the source with this cell reference.
4.  Click "**OK**".

Now, the Drop-Down List is linked to the cells in the "**Master Data**" sheet.

**Example of Dynamic Update:**

*   If you change "Game" to "Games" in cell A1 of "**Master Data**", the Drop-Down List will automatically reflect this change.

---

**Addressing the Limitation of Range-Based Dynamic Lists: Adding New Divisions**

**Problem:** If you add a new division (e.g., "Health") below the existing list in "**Master Data**" (A4), the Drop-Down List *will not* automatically include it.  The Data Validation is currently restricted to the initial range (A1:A3).

**Initial Solution (Manual Insertion):**

*   **Insert Rows in the Middle:** Instead of adding new divisions at the bottom, insert a new row *within* the existing range and add the new division there.
    *   Example: Insert a row between "Utility" and the next entry (if any), and add "Health" in the newly inserted row.
*   **Using Shift Key for Insertion:** You can also use the **Shift Key** to insert rows in the middle of the list.
    *   Select a cell within the list, and use the **Shift + Insert Row** shortcut (or right-click and select "Insert" -> "Shift cells down"). This effectively inserts a row and pushes existing entries down, keeping the new entry within the originally defined range.

**Limitation of Manual Insertion:** This method requires remembering to insert rows rather than just adding to the bottom, which can be inconvenient and error-prone, especially with frequent updates.

---

**Advanced Solution: Using Excel Tables for Truly Dynamic Lists**

To achieve automatic updates when adding divisions at the *bottom* of the list, convert the list into an **Excel Table**.

1.  **Convert the Division List to a Table:**
    *   Go to the "**Master Data**" sheet.
    *   Click anywhere within the division list (e.g., cell A1).
    *   Press **Ctrl + T**.
    *   In the "**Create Table**" dialog, ensure "**My table has headers**" is checked if your list has a header row (in this case, it's likely not needed as we just have division names). Click "**OK**".
2.  **Clear Table Style (Optional):** Excel automatically applies a table style. To remove it, go to the "**Table Design**" tab, and in the "**Table Styles**" group, choose "**Clear**".
3.  **Rename the Table (Optional but Recommended):** In the "**Table Design**" tab, in the "**Properties**" group, change the "**Table Name**" from the default (e.g., "Table1") to a more descriptive name, like "**TableDiv**", and press **Enter**.
4.  **Table Referencing:** Excel Tables use structured references. If you create a formula and select the division column in the table, you'll see this type of reference: `TableDiv[division]` (assuming "division" is the header of your column – in our case, if there's no header, it might just be `TableDiv[[#All],[Column1]]` or similar, but for data validation, simply referencing the column name is sufficient if the table has a header row).
5.  **Use Table Reference in Data Validation:**
    *   Go back to your Data Validation settings for the "**Division**" column.
    *   In the "**Source**" box, instead of a cell range, use the table column reference.  However, **Data Validation directly does not accept table structured references**.
6.  **Using the INDIRECT Function:** To use a table reference in Data Validation, you need to use the **INDIRECT Function**.
    *   In the "**Source**" box, type: `=INDIRECT("TableDiv[division]")`  (or `=INDIRECT("TableDiv[[#All],[Column1]]")` if no header and column is the first one).  **Important:**  Enclose the table reference within quotes because **INDIRECT** takes a text string as input.
    *   Click "**OK**".

**Advantage of Table-Based Dynamic List:**

*   **Automatic Range Expansion:** Now, if you add a new division (e.g., "Health") at the *bottom* of the table in "**Master Data**", the table range automatically expands to include the new entry.
*   **Dynamic Drop-Down Update:**  The Drop-Down List, powered by the table reference via **INDIRECT**, will automatically include the newly added "Health" division without needing to manually adjust ranges or insert rows.

---

**Alternative Method: Using Name Manager (Less Efficient for this case)**

While the video briefly mentions the **Name Manager**, using **INDIRECT** is more direct and efficient for this dynamic table scenario.  You *could* define a named range in the **Name Manager** that refers to the table column, and then use that name in Data Validation. However, this adds an extra step compared to directly using **INDIRECT**.

---

**Enhancing User Experience: Input Messages and Error Alerts**

Data Validation can also provide helpful messages to guide users.

1.  **Input Message:**
    *   In the "**Data Validation**" dialog, go to the "**Input Message**" tab.
    *   **Title:**  Enter a title for the message box (e.g., "Select Division").
    *   **Input message:** Enter the message to be displayed when a cell with data validation is selected (e.g., "Please make a selection from the list").
    *   Click "**OK**".
    *   Now, when a user selects a cell with this Data Validation, an informational message box will appear.

2.  **Error Alert:**
    *   In the "**Data Validation**" dialog, go to the "**Error Alert**" tab.
    *   **Style:** Choose the error style (e.g., "Stop", "Warning", "Information"). "Stop" is the most restrictive and prevents invalid entries.
    *   **Title (Optional):**  Enter a title for the error message box. If left blank, Excel will use a default title.
    *   **Error message:**  Enter a custom error message to be displayed when a user enters invalid data (e.g., "Please select from the list").
    *   Click "**OK**".
    *   If a user enters invalid data (e.g., types "prod" instead of selecting from the Drop-Down), the custom error message will be displayed. If no custom message is set, Excel will display a default error message.

---

**Exploring Other Data Validation Types: Beyond Lists**

Let's examine other Data Validation options for different columns in our template.

**1. Project Start Date Validation:**

*   **Requirement:** Date must be in the future (greater than today's date).
*   **Data Validation Settings:**
    1.  Select the "**Project Start Date**" column.
    2.  Open "**Data Validation**".
    3.  In the "**Settings**" tab, under "**Allow**", select "**Date**".
    4.  Under "**Data**", choose "**greater than**".
    5.  In the "**Start date**" box, enter the formula: `=TODAY()` (This formula dynamically uses the current date).
    6.  Go to the "**Input Message**" tab and set a message like:
        *   **Title:** "Project Start Date"
        *   **Input message:** "Please input project start date"
    7.  Go to the "**Error Alert**" tab and set an error message like:
        *   **Error message:** "Make sure it's a future date"
    8.  Click "**OK**".

**Example of Date Validation:**

*   Entering a past date (e.g., 7/7/2017) will trigger the error message.
*   Entering a future date (e.g., 7/7/2018) will be accepted.

**2. Project Number Validation:**

*   **Requirement:** Four-digit number between 1000 and 2000.
*   **Data Validation Settings:**
    1.  Select the "**Project Number**" column.
    2.  Open "**Data Validation**".
    3.  In the "**Settings**" tab, under "**Allow**", select "**Whole number**".
    4.  Under "**Data**", choose "**between**".
    5.  **Minimum:** `1000`
    6.  **Maximum:** `2000`
    7.  (Optional) Set Input and Error messages similar to the Date example.
    8.  Click "**OK**".

**Example of Whole Number Validation:**

*   Entering `1000` is valid.
*   Entering a number outside the range (e.g., `999` or `2001`) will trigger an error.

**3. Company Code Validation:**

*   **Requirement:** Must be exactly five characters long.
*   **Data Validation Settings:**
    1.  Select the "**Company Code**" column.
    2.  Open "**Data Validation**".
    3.  In the "**Settings**" tab, under "**Allow**", select "**Text length**".
    4.  Under "**Data**", choose "**equal to**".
    5.  **Length:** `5`
    6.  (Optional) Set Input and Error messages.
    7.  Click "**OK**".

**Example of Text Length Validation:**

*   Entering "S2010" (five characters) is valid.
*   Entering "SE2010" (six characters) or "S201" (four characters) will trigger an error.

**Advanced Custom Validation (Mentioned but Not Detailed):**

*   For more complex validation rules (e.g., specific character types, patterns), you can use the "**Custom**" option in "**Data Validation**" and enter formulas. This is an advanced topic not covered in detail in this video but can be explored in future content.

**4. Project Description Validation:**

*   **Requirement:** Text must be at least 20 characters long (to encourage elaboration).
*   **Data Validation Settings:**
    1.  Select the "**Project Description**" column.
    2.  Open "**Data Validation**".
    3.  In the "**Settings**" tab, under "**Allow**", select "**Text length**".
    4.  Under "**Data**", choose "**greater than or equal to**".
    5.  **Minimum:** `20`
    6.  (Optional) Set Input and Error messages.
    7.  Click "**OK**".

**Example of Text Length Validation (Minimum Length):**

*   Entering "it will be amazing" (less than 20 characters) will trigger an error.
*   Entering "because it's for our health, it will be amazing" (more than 20 characters) will be accepted.

**Applying Data Validation to Multiple Rows: Copying and Pasting Validation**

To apply the created Data Validation rules to multiple rows:

1.  **Select the Cells with Validation:** Highlight the first row (or cells) where you have set up Data Validation.
2.  **Copy:** Press **Ctrl + C**.
3.  **Select Target Range:** Highlight the range of cells where you want to apply the same Data Validation.
4.  **Paste Special - Validation:** Right-click within the selected target range. Choose "**Paste Special**" and then select "**Validation**". Click "**OK**".

This will copy *only* the Data Validation rules to the target cells, without copying the content or formatting from the original cells.

---

**Conclusion: Benefits of Data Validation**

Using **Data Validation** in Excel templates:

*   Reduces data entry errors.
*   Ensures data consistency and accuracy.
*   Saves time by minimizing the need for manual error correction.
*   Makes data easier to process and analyze.
*   Improves the overall user experience and template usability.

Data Validation helps make everyone's life easier by proactively preventing common input mistakes.

# **Creating Complex Data Validation Checks in Excel**

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDXQy60BcT4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDXQy60BcT4)

**Introduction:**

In this tutorial, we will explore how to create complex data validation checks in **Excel**. This is crucial to ensure that users inputting data into your templates do not make mistakes, especially when specific combinations of text and numbers are required in a cell.

- This tutorial builds upon the basics of **Excel's Data Validation**, which was covered in a previous video.
    -  If you missed the previous video, a link will be provided below this video.
- We will delve into more complex scenarios beyond the basic data validation rules.

**Goal:**

To understand and implement **Excel's custom data validation** by solving three specific cases.

---

## **Case 1: Company Code Validation - Text followed by Four Digits**

**Problem Description:**

We need to create a data validation rule that enforces the following format for a company code:

-   The code must consist of five characters.
-   The first character must be any text (non-numeric).
-   The following four characters must be digits (numeric).

**Approach:**

We will use a formula within **Excel's custom data validation** to perform these checks. To simplify the formula creation process, we will initially build and test the formula in worksheet cells before applying it to the data validation setting. This allows us to leverage **Excel's formula help** and step-by-step evaluation.

**Formula Creation in Worksheet Cells:**

Let's break down the required checks and create individual formulas:

1.  **Check 1: Total Number of Characters is Five**

    -   Formula: `=LEN(A5)`  (Assuming the cell with the input value is **A5**)
    -   Purpose:  To count the total characters in the input cell.
    -   Test: `=LEN(A5)=5`
        -   This formula returns **TRUE** if the length is 5, and **FALSE** otherwise.

2.  **Check 2: Last Four Characters are Numbers**

    -   Formula to extract the last four characters: `=RIGHT(A5,4)`
        -   The **RIGHT** function extracts a specified number of characters from the right side of a text string.
    -   Formula to check if the extracted characters are numeric: `=ISNUMBER(VALUE(RIGHT(A5,4)))`
        -   **VALUE** function: Converts a text string that represents a number to a number.  This is important because **RIGHT** function returns text, even if it looks like a number.
        -   **ISNUMBER** function: Checks if a value is a number and returns **TRUE** or **FALSE**.
        -   **Explanation:**  Initially, `ISNUMBER(RIGHT(A5,4))` might return **FALSE** even for numeric strings because **RIGHT** extracts text. Using **VALUE** converts the text number to an actual number, allowing **ISNUMBER** to function correctly.

3.  **Check 3: First Character is Non-Numeric**

    -   Formula to extract the first character: `=LEFT(A5,1)`
        -   The **LEFT** function extracts a specified number of characters from the left side of a text string.
    -   Formula to check if the first character is NOT a number: `=NOT(ISNUMBER(VALUE(LEFT(A5,1))))`
        -   **NOT** function: Reverses the logical value of its argument. If **ISNUMBER** returns **TRUE** (meaning it's a number), **NOT** makes it **FALSE**, and vice versa.
        -   **Explanation:** We check if the first character is *not* a number.  Similar to the previous check, **VALUE** and **ISNUMBER** are used to properly evaluate if the first character (extracted as text by **LEFT**) is a number. Then **NOT** inverts the result to confirm it's *not* a number (i.e., it is text).

**Combining the Checks into a Single Formula:**

To ensure all three conditions are met, we use the **AND** function:

-   Combined Formula: `=AND(LEN(A5)=5, ISNUMBER(VALUE(RIGHT(A5,4))), NOT(ISNUMBER(VALUE(LEFT(A5,1)))))`
    -   The **AND** function returns **TRUE** only if all its arguments are **TRUE**. In this case, it will return **TRUE** only if the length is 5, the last four characters are numbers, and the first character is not a number.

**Implementing Data Validation in Excel:**

1.  **Copy** the combined formula: `=AND(LEN(A5)=5, ISNUMBER(VALUE(RIGHT(A5,4))), NOT(ISNUMBER(VALUE(LEFT(A5,1)))))`
2.  **Select** the cell(s) where you want to apply the data validation.
3.  Go to the **Data** tab in the Excel ribbon.
4.  Click on **Data Validation**.
5.  In the **Data Validation** dialog box:
    -   Under the **Settings** tab, in the **Allow** dropdown, select **Custom**.
    -   In the **Formula** box, **paste** the copied formula.
6.  Optionally, go to the **Input Message** tab to add a helpful message for users.
7.  Optionally, go to the **Error Alert** tab to customize the error message displayed when validation fails.
8.  Click **OK**.

**Testing the Data Validation:**

-   Input values like "C1234" (Valid) - Should be accepted.
-   Input values like "12345" (Invalid - first character is a number) - Should be rejected.
-   Input values like "C123" (Invalid - length is not 5) - Should be rejected.
-   Input values like "C123A" (Invalid - last character is not a number) - Should be rejected.

---

## **Case 2: Fixed Prefix "PT" followed by Four Digits**

**Problem Description:**

We need to validate an input to ensure it:

-   Is six characters long.
-   Starts with the fixed letters "PT" (first two characters).
-   Is followed by four digits (last four characters).

**Approach:**

Similar to Case 1, we will create a formula using **Excel's custom data validation**.  We will reuse some of the checks from Case 1 and add a new check for the fixed prefix "PT".

**Formula Creation:**

1.  **Check 1: Total Number of Characters is Six**

    -   Formula: `=LEN(A5)=6` (Assuming the cell with the input value is **A5**)

2.  **Check 2: Last Four Characters are Numbers**

    -   Formula: `=ISNUMBER(VALUE(RIGHT(A5,4)))`  (Same as Case 1)

3.  **Check 3: First Two Characters are "PT"**

    -   Formula: `=LEFT(A5,2)="PT"`
        -   **LEFT(A5,2)** extracts the first two characters.
        -   `="PT"` compares the extracted two characters to the text "PT".

**Combining the Checks:**

-   Combined Formula: `=AND(LEN(A5)=6, ISNUMBER(VALUE(RIGHT(A5,4))), LEFT(A5,2)="PT")`

**Implementing Data Validation:**

The implementation steps are the same as in Case 1, just using this new combined formula in the **Custom** data validation setting.

**Testing the Data Validation:**

-   Input values like "PT1234" (Valid) - Should be accepted.
-   Input values like "PQ1234" (Invalid - prefix is not "PT") - Should be rejected.
-   Input values like "PT123" (Invalid - length is not 6) - Should be rejected.
-   Input values like "PT123A" (Invalid - last character is not a number) - Should be rejected.

---

## **Case 3: Two Non-Numeric Letters followed by Four Digits**

**Problem Description:**

We need to validate an input to ensure it:

-   Is six characters long.
-   Starts with two non-numeric characters (first two characters can be any letters).
-   Is followed by four digits (last four characters).

**Approach:**

We will adapt the approach from Case 1, focusing on validating that the first *two* characters are non-numeric.

**Formula Creation:**

1.  **Check 1: Total Number of Characters is Six**

    -   Formula: `=LEN(A5)=6` (Assuming the cell with the input value is **A5**)

2.  **Check 2: Last Four Characters are Numbers**

    -   Formula: `=ISNUMBER(VALUE(RIGHT(A5,4)))` (Same as Case 1 and 2)

3.  **Check 3: First Character is Non-Numeric**

    -   Formula: `=NOT(ISNUMBER(VALUE(LEFT(A5,1))))` (Same logic as Case 1, adapted for first character)

4.  **Check 4: Second Character is Non-Numeric**

    -   Formula: `=NOT(ISNUMBER(VALUE(MID(A5,2,1))))`
        -   **MID(A5,2,1)**: Extracts a specific number of characters from the *middle* of a text string.
            -   **A5**: The text string.
            -   **2**: The starting position (2nd character).
            -   **1**: Number of characters to extract (1 character - the second character).
        -   The rest of the formula `NOT(ISNUMBER(VALUE(...)))` is the same logic as in Check 3, but applied to the second character extracted by **MID**.

**Combining the Checks:**

-   Combined Formula: `=AND(LEN(A5)=6, ISNUMBER(VALUE(RIGHT(A5,4))), NOT(ISNUMBER(VALUE(LEFT(A5,1)))), NOT(ISNUMBER(VALUE(MID(A5,2,1)))))`

**Implementing Data Validation:**

The implementation steps remain the same as in previous cases, using this combined formula in the **Custom** data validation setting.

**Testing the Data Validation:**

-   Input values like "TT1234" (Valid) - Should be accepted.
-   Input values like "T12345" (Invalid - second character is numeric) - Should be rejected.
-   Input values like "1T1234" (Invalid - first character is numeric) - Should be rejected.
-   Input values like "TT123" (Invalid - length is not 6) - Should be rejected.
-   Input values like "TT123A" (Invalid - last character is not a number) - Should be rejected.

---

**Important Notes:**

-   **Helper Cells:**  During formula creation, using cells to build and test individual parts of the formula (like we did with **A5** and subsequent formulas in the example) is highly recommended for complex validations.  These helper cells can be removed once the final formula is working correctly and implemented in data validation.
-   **Error Messages and Input Prompts:** Remember to customize the **Input Message** and **Error Alert** tabs in the **Data Validation** dialog box to provide clear instructions and helpful error messages to users. This enhances the usability of your Excel templates.
-   **Alternative Array Functions (and Name Manager Consideration):**  While functions like **AGGREGATE** might offer alternative approaches, they may not work directly within the **Data Validation** formula box. In such cases, you might need to use **Excel's Name Manager** to define a named formula and then refer to that name in your data validation rule. However, the method demonstrated in this tutorial avoids the need for **Name Manager** by using formulas directly compatible with data validation.

---

**Conclusion:**

This tutorial demonstrated how to use **Excel's custom data validation** to create sophisticated checks for data input. By breaking down complex validation rules into smaller, manageable checks and combining them with logical functions like **AND**, you can ensure data accuracy and consistency in your Excel templates. Remember to utilize helper cells for formula development and customize input messages and error alerts for a better user experience.

## **Setting Your Default Excel Theme Color**

**(Video URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiHO5TzHjrk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiHO5TzHjrk))**

This guide will show you how to configure Excel so that your preferred theme color is the default every time you open the application.

### **The Issue: Excel's Default Office Theme**

By default, Excel always reverts to the **Office theme color**.  If your company has defined its own theme colors, you might already be familiar with browsing and applying them as custom themes.

*   Currently, if you want to use your custom theme, you must manually select it each time you open Excel.
*   This means navigating to the theme options and choosing your preferred theme every time you want to use it.

Many users, particularly those who consistently work with custom themes (say, **90% of the time**), want to bypass this manual selection process. They desire that every new workbook automatically uses their custom theme instead of the Office theme.

### **Excel's Limitation: No Direct "Set as Default" Option**

Unlike **Microsoft Word**, Excel lacks a direct "Set as Default Theme" option.

*   **In Word:** Under the **Design** tab, you can select a theme and find a "**Set as Default**" tick mark, making it the default theme for new documents.
*   **In Excel:** This convenient "Set as Default" option is **not available**.

### **The Solution: Leveraging Excel Templates and the "Excel Start" Folder**

To achieve a default custom theme in Excel, the workaround involves saving an empty Excel spreadsheet with your desired theme as an **Excel template** within your **Excel Start folder**. This method tricks Excel into loading your template with the chosen theme every time it starts or creates a new workbook.

### **Understanding Excel Themes: Colors, Fonts, and Effects**

Before setting up the default theme, it's crucial to understand what constitutes an Excel theme. A theme is essentially a combination of:

*   **Colors:** Specifically, the **theme colors**, which are a palette of colors used for various elements within Excel.
*   **Fonts:**  The **theme fonts**, defining the default heading and body fonts.
*   **Effects:** Theme effects, which are more subtle visual styles.

The importance of themes, especially **theme colors**, becomes apparent when working with charts.

#### **Theme Colors and Charts:**

Let's illustrate how theme colors impact charts:

1.  **Chart Creation Example:**  If you select some data and insert a chart (e.g., a simple column chart), the chart series colors are automatically populated.
2.  **Color Source:** These default chart colors are derived from the **theme colors**.
3.  **Accent Colors:** Specifically, the chart series colors correspond to the **accent colors** defined in your theme:
    *   The **first series** in your chart uses **Accent 1**.
    *   The **second series** uses **Accent 2**.
    *   And so on.
4.  **Benefits of Custom Themes for Charts:** Defining your own theme colors saves you the repetitive task of manually changing series colors in charts every time.
5.  **Office Theme Default Colors:** The default **Office theme colors** may not always be your preferred palette, necessitating customization.

### **Creating Your Custom Theme Colors (Example: "LG Default One")**

You can easily define your own theme colors:

1.  **Access Theme Colors Customization:** Navigate to the theme color options (typically found under **Page Layout** tab, then **Colors**, then **Customize Colors...**).
2.  **Define Custom Accent Colors:**  Modify the **Accent** colors to your preferences. For example, in the video:
    *   **Accent 1:** Black
    *   **Accent 2:** Dark Gray
    *   **Accent 3:** Orange
3.  **Name Your Custom Color Set:**  Give your custom color set a descriptive name (e.g., "**LG default one**").
4.  **Save the Custom Color Set.**
5.  **Customize Theme Fonts (Optional):**  Similarly, you can customize the **theme fonts** if desired (under **Page Layout** tab, then **Fonts**, then **Customize Fonts...**).
6.  **Save the Complete Theme:** Once you are satisfied with your color and font choices, save the entire theme.
    *   Go to **Page Layout** tab, then **Themes**, then **Save Current Theme...**.
    *   Name your theme (e.g., "**theme LG default**").
    *   Themes are typically saved by default in the "**Document Themes**" folder within your "**Templates**" folder.
    *   Click "**Save**".

### **Setting the Custom Theme as Default: Step-by-Step Guide**

Now, let's implement the solution to make your custom theme the default:

1.  **Open a Blank Workbook:** Create a new blank Excel workbook.
2.  **Apply Your Custom Theme:**
    *   Go to the **Page Layout** tab.
    *   Click on **Themes**.
    *   Select the custom theme you just created ("**theme LG default**" in the example).
    *   **Note:** This is the *only* change you need to make to this blank workbook.
3.  **Save as Excel Template:**
    *   Go to **File** > **Save As**.
    *   Choose "**Excel Template (*.xltx)**" as the file type.
    *   **Finding the Excel Start Folder:**  You can try to save directly into the **Excel Start folder** from the "Save As" dialog.
        *   It might be directly accessible in the file explorer navigation pane.
        *   If not, you may need to manually locate the folder. The video creator suggests saving to the desktop temporarily and then finding the "Excel Start" folder separately.
4.  **Save to Desktop (Temporary Step - If needed):** For easier folder location, save the template to your **Desktop** initially.  Name it something recognizable, like "**Book**" (important to remove numbers later).
5.  **Locate the "Excel Start" Folder:**
    *   The video suggests using the Windows search function to find the "**Excel Start**" folder.
    *   Search for "**Excel Start**" in the Windows Explorer search bar.
    *   It might take a few moments for Windows to locate it.
6.  **Move the Template to the "Excel Start" Folder:**
    *   Once you've found the "**Excel Start**" folder, locate the template file you saved on your desktop (e.g., "**Book.xltx**").
    *   **Cut** (Ctrl+X) the template file.
    *   **Paste** (Ctrl+V) the template file into the "**Excel Start**" folder.
7.  **Crucial Step: Remove Numbering from Template Filename:**
    *   **Important:**  In the "**Excel Start**" folder, rename the template file.
    *   **Delete any numbers** from the filename. For example, if it's named "**Book1.xltx**" or "**Book2.xltx**", rename it to just "**Book.xltx**".  This is a critical step.
8.  **Close Excel:** Close any open Excel instances.

### **Verification: Testing Your Default Theme**

To confirm that your custom theme is now the default:

1.  **Open Excel or Create a New Workbook:**
    *   Open Excel normally.
    *   Or, press **Ctrl + N** to create a new workbook.
    *   Or, use the "**New**" icon in your **Quick Access Toolbar** (if you have added it).
2.  **Check the Page Layout Tab:**
    *   Go to the **Page Layout** tab.
    *   Look at the **Themes** section.
    *   You should see your custom theme ("**theme LG default**" in the example) already selected as the active theme.

Every time you create a new workbook (using Ctrl+N or the "New" icon), it will now automatically use your defined custom theme.

### **Key Takeaways: Three Important Points to Remember**

The video emphasizes three critical points for this method to work correctly:

1.  **Save in the "Excel Start" Folder:** The template *must* be saved in the "**Excel Start**" folder.
2.  **Remove Numbering from Filename:** Delete any numbers from the template filename (e.g., rename "Book1.xltx" to "Book.xltx").
3.  **Save as Excel Template:** Ensure you save the file as an "**Excel Template (.xltx)**", and it should be based on a **blank Excel spreadsheet**.

### **Conclusion: Save Time with Your Default Custom Theme**

By following these steps, you can successfully set your preferred custom theme as the default in Excel. This will save you time and effort by eliminating the need to manually select your theme every time you create a new Excel report or workbook. Enjoy using your custom theme consistently!

**Video Tutorial: Adding Headers and Footers in Excel**

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6b315vRNrg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6b315vRNrg)

**Introduction**

In this video, you will learn how to add headers and footers to your Excel worksheets. Headers and footers are useful for:

*   Adding company logos to the header of each printed page.
*   Including page numbers in the footer of printed pages and PDF documents.
*   Customizing logos or pictures to ensure they fit properly within the header area.

A common question addressed in this tutorial is how to efficiently apply a header created for one worksheet tab to multiple tabs simultaneously.

**Example Spreadsheet and Initial Setup**

We will be using a sample spreadsheet with multiple tabs to demonstrate the process. For the initial demonstration, we will be working in tab **T2**.  We will begin by adding a header to this specific tab.

**Method 1: Accessing Header & Footer Settings via Page Layout**

There are two primary methods to access header and footer settings in Excel. The first method involves the **Page Layout** tab:

1.  Navigate to the **Page Layout** tab in the Excel ribbon.
2.  Locate the **Page Setup** group.
3.  Click on the small icon at the bottom right of the **Page Setup** group to open the **Page Setup** dialog box.
4.  In the **Page Setup** dialog box, go to the **Header/Footer** tab.
5.  Here, you have the options to:
    *   Add a **Custom Header**
    *   Add a **Custom Footer**

**Method 2: Accessing Header & Footer Settings via View Tab (User-Friendly Approach)**

The second, and arguably more user-friendly, method is through the **View** tab. This method provides a visual preview of the header and footer as you design them.

1.  Go to the **View** tab in the Excel ribbon.
2.  Within the **View** tab, click on **Page Layout**.
    *   This view displays your worksheet as it would appear when printed, including header and footer areas.
    *   Directly in this **Page Layout** view, you can see and interact with the header and footer sections.

**Adding Content to the Header**

When you activate the header area in **Page Layout** view (by clicking within the header section), a new contextual tab, **Design**, will appear in the ribbon under **Header & Footer Tools**.

*   This **Design** tab provides tools specifically for customizing headers and footers.
*   You have three header sections available: **Left**, **Center**, and **Right**. You can use one, two, or all three sections.

**Example: Adding File Name and Sheet Name to the Header**

Let's add the file name to the left header section and the sheet name to the second line in the same section:

1.  In the **Design** tab, within the **Header & Footer Elements** group, click on **File Name**.
    *   This inserts the code `&[File]` into the header section.
2.  Click outside the header area to see the file name displayed.
3.  To add a second line, click back into the header area and press **Enter**.
4.  In the **Design** tab, click on **Sheet Name**.
    *   This inserts the code `&[Tab]` on the second line.
5.  Click outside the header area to see both the file name and sheet name (e.g., "T2") displayed in the header.

**Adding Pictures/Logos to the Header**

You can also insert pictures, such as company logos, into the header.

1.  To replace the existing header content, select and delete the file name and sheet name entries in the header section.
2.  In the **Design** tab, within the **Header & Footer Elements** group, click on **Picture**.
3.  In the **Insert Picture** dialog box, navigate to and select your logo file.
4.  Click **Insert**.
    *   This inserts the code `&[Picture]` into the header section.
5.  Click outside the header area to view the inserted picture/logo.

**Formatting Pictures in the Header**

If the logo is too large or needs adjustment, you can format it directly from the **Design** tab.

1.  Select the header section containing the picture.
2.  In the **Design** tab, within the **Header & Footer Elements** group, click on **Format Picture** (located next to the **Picture** button).
3.  In the **Format Picture** dialog box, go to the **Size** tab.
4.  To resize proportionally, ensure the **Lock aspect ratio** checkbox is checked.
5.  Adjust the **Height** percentage. For example, change it to **70%** to reduce the size.
6.  Click **OK**.
7.  Click outside the header area to see the resized logo.

**Adjusting Picture Position within the Header**

To fine-tune the vertical position of the picture:

1.  Select the header section containing the picture.
2.  Click **Format Picture** again in the **Design** tab.
3.  Go to the **Picture** tab in the **Format Picture** dialog box.
4.  Adjust the **Top margin** in the **Crop from** section. For example, increase the **Top** margin by **0.2 points** to move the picture down slightly.
5.  Click **OK**.
6.  Click outside the header area to observe the position adjustment.

**Adding Content to the Footer**

Navigating to the footer is straightforward:

*   You can scroll down in **Page Layout** view to reach the footer area.
*   Alternatively, in the **Design** tab, click on **Go to Footer** to quickly jump to the footer section.

**Utilizing Footer Presets and Customization**

Similar to headers, footers also have left, center, and right sections and offer preset options.

1.  Click within one of the footer sections to activate it and the **Design** tab.
2.  In the **Design** tab, within the **Header & Footer** group, you can see preset footer options.
3.  For example, select a preset that includes page numbers and "Confidential."
4.  Click outside the footer area to apply the preset and view it.

**Customizing Footer Content Example**

Let's customize a footer to display "Training Material," the sheet name, and page numbers in the format "Page X of Y":

1.  In the footer section, replace "Confidential" with "Training Material."
2.  Replace the date with **Sheet Name** from the **Header & Footer Elements** group in the **Design** tab.
3.  For page numbers, use a combination of **Page Number** and **Number of Pages** from the **Header & Footer Elements** group, separated by a dash and "of".
    *   Enter `Page &[Page] of &[Pages]` to achieve "Page 1 of 2" format (for example).
4.  Click outside the footer area to view the customized footer.

**Print Preview to Review Header and Footer**

To see how the header and footer will appear on a printed page:

1.  Go to **File** in the Excel ribbon.
2.  Click on **Print**.
    *   The print preview screen will display the worksheet with the applied header and footer.

**Applying the Same Header and Footer to Multiple Worksheets**

To apply the header and footer from one sheet to other sheets efficiently:

1.  **Select the Original Sheet:** Ensure the worksheet with the desired header and footer (e.g., **T2**) is selected.
2.  **Select Target Sheets:**
    *   To select specific sheets, hold down **Ctrl** and click on the tabs of the worksheets you want to apply the header/footer to (e.g., **T1**, **T3**).
    *   To select all sheets, right-click on any sheet tab and choose **Select All Sheets**.
3.  **Activate Header or Footer:** With all desired sheets selected (grouped), activate either the header or footer area in **Page Layout** view on the *original* sheet.  Simply clicking inside the header or footer area on the selected sheet is sufficient. You don't need to make any changes.
4.  **Click Away:** Click outside the header/footer area (e.g., back into the worksheet cells) to apply the header/footer settings to all selected sheets.

**Verification**

*   Navigate to the other selected tabs (e.g., **T3**, **T1**) and check the **Print Preview** (**File > Print**) to confirm that the header and footer have been applied consistently across all selected sheets.
*   When multiple sheets are selected and you go to print preview, Excel will show a combined preview of all selected sheets, allowing you to see page numbering across the entire grouped selection.

**Removing Headers and Footers from Multiple Worksheets**

To remove headers and footers from multiple sheets simultaneously:

1.  **Select the Sheets:** Select the worksheets from which you want to remove headers and footers (using the same sheet selection methods as described above).
2.  **Access Page Setup via Page Layout:** Go to the **Page Layout** tab and click the **Page Setup** icon to open the **Page Setup** dialog box.
3.  **Navigate to Header/Footer Tab:** Go to the **Header/Footer** tab in the **Page Setup** dialog box.
4.  **Set Header and Footer to "None":**
    *   In the **Header** dropdown menu, select **(none)**.
    *   In the **Footer** dropdown menu, select **(none)**.
5.  Click **OK**.

**Verification**

*   Check the **Print Preview** for any of the selected sheets to confirm that the headers and footers have been removed from all of them.

**Conclusion**

This tutorial demonstrated how to effectively add and customize headers and footers in Excel, and importantly, how to apply these settings across multiple worksheets at once.  You now have the tools to enhance your printed and PDF Excel documents with logos, page numbers, and other essential information.

## **Excel Comments: Mastering Notes and Customization**

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PhaaEWY1pQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PhaaEWY1pQ)

Let's dive into the world of **Excel Comments** and discover how to enhance your workflow and efficiency when using them. We'll start with the fundamentals and then move on to the exciting part: customizing comment backgrounds and incorporating icons into your comments!

**Important Note on Terminology:**

Microsoft has recently introduced a new feature called **Threaded comments**. This allows for interactive discussions within Excel, similar to chat threads, while thankfully retaining the original comment functionality. This update has led to a change in terminology:

*   What we traditionally know as an **Excel comment** is now being referred to as an **Excel note**.
*   The new **Threaded comments** feature includes a **Reply box** and is part of the Office 365 suite of features.

For this video, we will be focusing on what are currently known as **comments**, but will be referred to as **notes** in the future. So, let's get started!

**(Upbeat music)**

---

## **Working with Excel Notes (Formerly "Comments")**

### **Shortcut Keys for Notes**

*   **Identifying Notes:** You can easily spot cells with notes by the small **red icon** located in the top right corner of the cell.

*   **Inserting a Note:** To insert a new note using a shortcut key:
    *   Press **Shift + F2**.
        *   Remember: **F2** is used to edit cell content, while **Shift + F2** is specifically for notes.
    *   Start typing your note.

*   **Editing an Existing Note:** To edit a note that's already present:
    *   Select the cell with the note.
    *   Press **Shift + F2**.
    *   Continue typing to edit the existing content or add more information.

### **Menu Options for Notes**

*   **Inserting a Note via the Ribbon:**
    *   Go to the **Review tab** in the Excel ribbon.
    *   Click on **New Comment** (which will become "New Note" in future updates).

*   **Navigating Between Notes:**
    *   In the **Review tab**, use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons to jump between notes in your worksheet.

*   **Inserting a Note via Right-Click Menu:**
    *   **Right-click** on the cell where you want to insert a note.
    *   Select **Insert Comment** (which will become "Insert Note" in future updates) from the context menu.

### **Showing and Hiding Notes**

*   **Showing All Notes on the Sheet:**
    *   Go to the **Review tab**.

    *   This is a **toggle** function:
        *   Click once to display all notes.
        *   Click again to hide all notes.

*   **Showing/Hiding a Single Note:**
    *   Select the cell containing the specific note you want to control.
    *   In the **Review tab**, click on **Show/Hide Comment** (will become "Show/Hide Note").
        *   This option allows you to control the visibility of individual notes.

---

## **Printing Notes**

Excel offers two methods for printing notes:

*   **As displayed on sheet:** Notes are printed exactly as they are visible on the worksheet.
*   **At the end of the sheet:** Notes are printed together on a separate page(s) at the end of your worksheet.

**To Configure Note Printing Options:**

1.  Go to the **Page Layout tab**.
2.  In the **Page Setup** group (or **Sheet Options** group, depending on your Excel version), click the **small arrow** in the bottom right corner to open the **Page Setup** dialog box.
3.  Navigate to the **Sheet tab**.
4.  Under the **Comments** section, choose your preferred printing method from the dropdown menu:
    *   **"(none)"**: Notes are not printed.
    *   **"As displayed on sheet"**: Prints visible notes in their positions on the sheet.
        *   **Example:** If only one note is visible and "As displayed on sheet" is selected, only that visible note will appear in the print preview.
    *   **"At end of sheet"**: Prints all notes at the end of the document, regardless of their on-screen visibility.
        *   **Example:** Selecting "At end of sheet" and going to **Print Preview** then scrolling down will show all notes listed separately at the end of the printed output.

## **Copying and Pasting Notes**

*   **Copying a Note:**
    *   Select the cell containing the note you want to copy.
    *   Press **Ctrl + C** to copy the cell (and its note).

*   **Pasting Only the Note to Another Cell(s):**
    *   Select the destination cell(s) where you want to paste the note.
    *   **Right-click** on the selected cell(s).
    *   Choose **Paste Special** from the context menu.
    *   In the **Paste Special** dialog box, select **Comments** (will become "Notes").
    *   Click **OK**.
        *   **Important:** This method only pastes the note; the content of the destination cell remains unchanged.

---

## **Customizing the Appearance of Notes**

You have various options to customize the visual style of your notes.

### **Formatting Notes (Color, Border, Font)**

1.  **Show the Note:** Ensure the note you want to customize is visible on the worksheet.
2.  **Access Formatting Options:**
    *   **Right-click** on the **border** of the displayed note.
    *   Select **Format Comment** (will become "Format Note") from the context menu.
    *   **Alternatively**, select the note's border and press **Ctrl + 1** to directly open the **Format Comment** dialog box.
3.  **Customize:** In the **Format Comment** dialog box, you can modify:
    *   **Background Color:** Choose from a variety of colors to fill the note box.
    *   **Border:**
        *   Change the border style, color, and thickness.
        *   Select **No Line** to remove the border completely.
    *   **Font:** Adjust the font type, style, size, and color for the text within the note.
4.  Click **OK** to apply your formatting changes.

### **Adding Background Images/Icons to Notes**

You can make your notes visually engaging by adding background images or icons. This example demonstrates using PowerPoint to prepare an icon for use as a note background.

**Steps to Add a Background Image to a Note:**

1.  **Prepare the Icon in PowerPoint (or another image editing tool):**
    *   **Open PowerPoint**.
    *   Go to **Insert > Icons**.
    *   **Select Icons:** Choose icons that you want to use as either background icons or as the main symbol within the note itself.
        *   **Example:** Select an icon like a checklist symbol or a screen comment icon.
    *   **Crop Icon (Optional):** If the icon has excessive whitespace, **crop** it to remove unnecessary background area for a cleaner look.
    *   **Save Icon as Picture:**
        *   **Right-click** on the selected icon.
        *   Choose **Save as Picture**.
        *   Select **PNG** as the file format for better image quality and transparency support.

    *   Repeat the "Save as Picture" process for any other icons you want to use.

2.  **Insert the Background Image into an Excel Note:**
    *   **Go back to Excel**.
    *   **Insert or Show a Note:** Select the cell where you want to add a background image and insert or show an existing note.
    *   **Select the Note's Border:** Click on the border of the note to select the entire note box.
    *   **Open Format Comment Dialog:** Press **Ctrl + 1** to open the **Format Comment** dialog box.
    *   **Navigate to Fill Effects:** Go to the **Colors and Lines** tab, and within the **Fill** section, click on **Fill effects**.
    *   **Select Picture Tab:** In the **Fill Effects** dialog box, go to the **Picture** tab.
    *   **Insert Picture:** Click on the **Select Picture...** button and locate the icon image file you saved earlier (e.g., "screen_comment.png"). Click **Insert**.
    *   **Lock Aspect Ratio (Recommended):** Check the **Lock picture aspect ratio** option to prevent distortion of the image when the note box is resized.
    *   Click **OK** in the **Fill Effects** dialog box.
    *   **Remove Border (Optional):** If you don't want a border around the note with the background image, go back to the **Colors and Lines** tab in the **Format Comment** dialog box and set **Line: No Line**.
    *   Click **OK** in the **Format Comment** dialog box to apply the background image.

3.  **Adjust Text Margins (If Necessary):**
    *   After applying a background image, you might need to adjust the text margins within the note to ensure the text is properly positioned and readable against the background.
    *   **Re-open Format Comment Dialog:** Select the note's border and press **Ctrl + 1**.
    *   **Go to Margins Tab:** Navigate to the **Margins** tab.
    *   **Adjust Margins:** Experiment with different margin values (e.g., 0.25 for all margins) to move the text more towards the center of the note and away from any background image borders. You can copy and paste values to apply them to all margins quickly.
    *   Click **OK** to apply margin adjustments.

4.  **Copy and Paste Customized Notes:** Once you have created a customized note with a background image and desired formatting, you can easily copy and paste this note to other cells using **Paste Special > Comments** (as described earlier), preserving all the customizations.

---

## **Example: Using a Checklist Symbol in a Note**

Following the same steps as above, you can insert other icons, like a checklist symbol, as a background in your notes. Simply repeat the process, selecting a different icon in PowerPoint and inserting it as the background image in the Excel note. You can then remove your name from the default note text to leave only the symbol visible within the note box. Adjust the size and positioning as needed.

### **Introduction: Calculating Percentages in Excel**

Today, we're diving into the world of **calculating percentages in Excel**. This tutorial will cover essential formulas for:

*   **Calculating percentage change.**
*   **Calculating percentage increase or decrease.**

These are crucial skills, especially if you're a financial analyst creating reports and need to ensure accuracy in your calculations. So, let's get started and learn these formulas in a way that's easy to remember!

---

### **1. Calculating Percentage Change**

Imagine your boss provides you with an Excel file containing:

*   **Actual sales data.**
*   **Budgeted sales data.**

Your task is to calculate the **percentage change** between these two figures. Let's break down the formula.

#### **Formula Explanation**

To calculate the percentage change, we use the following formula:

**(Actual - Budget) / Budget**

Here's an alternate way to express the same formula, which might help in understanding its logic:

**(Actual / Budget) - (Budget / Budget)**

Simplifying the second part of the alternate formula (Budget / Budget = 1), we get:

**(Actual / Budget) - 1**

**Therefore, the formula for percentage change is:**

**Actual divided by Budget, minus one.**

#### **Applying the Formula in Excel**

1.  Enter the formula into the desired cell in Excel.
2.  **Double click** on the bottom right corner of the cell containing the formula.
3.  This will **automatically apply the formula down** to the rest of the rows, calculating the percentage change for each corresponding row of data.

### **2. Calculating Percentage Increase or Decrease**

Now, let's move on to calculating **percentage increase or decrease**.

*   Assume you have a **starting price** in **Column A**.
*   In **Column B**, you have the **percentage** by which you want to increase or decrease the price. A positive percentage indicates an increase, and a negative percentage indicates a decrease.

Let's explore how to calculate the final price after applying this percentage change.

#### **Formula Explanation**

To calculate the price after a percentage increase or decrease, we start with the original price and adjust it based on the percentage. The formula is:

**Price + (Price \* Percentage)**

Another way to write this formula, which can be more efficient and easier to understand, is by factoring out the 'Price':

**Price \* (1 + Percentage)**

**Thus, the formula for percentage increase or decrease is:**

**Starting Price multiplied by (One plus the Percentage Change).**

#### **Applying the Formula in Excel**

1.  In Excel, enter the formula as: `=Starting Price * (1 + Percentage Change)`
2.  For example, if your starting price is **100** and you want to increase it by **10%**:
    *   Using the formula: `100 * (1 + 10%)`
    *   The result will be **110**.
3.  If you change the percentage to **5%**:
    *   The result will be **105**.

### **3. Inputting Percentages in Excel - Important Considerations**

When working with percentages in Excel, it's crucial to understand how to input them correctly to avoid errors. Here are a few methods and a critical point to remember:

#### **Methods to Input Percentages:**

*   **Method 1: Typing with the Percentage Sign (%)**
    *   Simply type the number followed by the **percentage sign (%)**.
    *   For example, typing `20%` and pressing Enter will automatically format the cell as a percentage and display **20%**.

*   **Method 2: Inputting as a Decimal**
    *   Enter the percentage as its decimal equivalent.
    *   For example, `0.05` is equivalent to **5%**. Excel will recognize this as a decimal value.
    *   If you have a formula using this decimal value, like the increase/decrease formula, it will calculate correctly.

*   **Method 3: Format Cell as Percentage First (Recommended)**
    *   **First, format the cell as a percentage** before entering the number.
    *   Then, input the numerical value **without the percentage sign**.
    *   For example, if you format a cell as percentage and then type `30`, Excel will correctly display it as **30%** (representing 30%).

#### **Caution: Formatting as Percentage After Inputting a Number (Incorrect)**

*   **Avoid formatting a cell as a percentage *after* you have already entered a whole number.**
*   For example, if you type `30` and then decide to format the cell as a percentage by clicking the percentage style button, Excel will **incorrectly** interpret it as **3000%** (because it multiplies 30 by 100).
*   **To correctly input 30% by formatting after typing, you would need to enter `0.30` and *then* format as a percentage.**

**In summary, it's generally safer and more intuitive to format the cell as a percentage *before* you input the numerical value.**

---

### **Summary of Key Formulas**

To recap, here are the formulas we've covered:

*   **Percentage Change:**
    *   **(New Value / Old Value) - 1**  (or Actual divided by Budget, minus one)

*   **Percentage Increase:**
    *   **Value \* (1 + Percentage Change)**

*   **Percentage Decrease:**
    *   While there's a separate concept of percentage decrease, you can use the **same Percentage Increase formula** and simply **input a negative percentage** value. Excel will handle it as a decrease. For example: `Value * (1 + (-10%))` will calculate a 10% decrease.
    *   Alternatively, conceptually, Percentage Decrease formula can be thought of as: **Value \* (1 - Percentage Change)** when considering percentage change as a positive decrease value.

**Video Title:** Mastering Find & Replace in Excel: Beyond the Basics

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3naynygx_dU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3naynygx_dU)

**(Introduction)**

Today's video dives into the **Find & Replace** feature in Excel.  You might be thinking, "Find & Replace? Really? Is a video necessary for something so straightforward?"  Especially if you're already familiar with it from other Office applications. Well, prepare to be surprised! *(upbeat music)* Let's explore the power of Find & Replace in Excel using these demo files and some practical examples.

---

**Accessing the Find Dialog Box**

First things first, how do we actually open the **Find** dialog box in Excel? There are two main ways:

*   **Using the Ribbon:**
    *   Navigate to the **Home** tab on the Excel ribbon.
    *   Locate the **Find & Select** group.
    *   Click on the **Find** option within this group.
*   **Using the Shortcut Key:**
    *   Press **Control + F** on your keyboard.

You're likely already familiar with the basic **Find** functionality from Excel and other Office applications.  So, we won't dwell on the absolute basics. Instead, let's jump straight into some of the more advanced and incredibly useful options available in Excel, which are often hidden under the "Options" tab within the Find dialog box.

---

**Exploring Advanced Find Options**

Let's consider a scenario where you are searching for the name "leila". Within the **Find** dialog box, you'll find several options to refine your search:

*   **Within:** This dropdown allows you to specify the scope of your search:
    *   **Sheet:**  Limits the search to the currently active worksheet.
    *   **Workbook:** Expands the search to include every single worksheet (tab) within the entire Excel workbook. This is useful for searching across multiple sheets simultaneously.
*   **Search:** This option dictates the direction of the search within a sheet:
    *   **By Rows:**  The search progresses horizontally, row by row.
    *   **By Columns:** The search progresses vertically, column by column.
*   **Look in:** This is a particularly handy option for specifying *where* Excel should look for your search term within a cell.  The options include:
    *   **Formulas:**  Searches within the formulas entered in cells.
    *   **Values:**  Searches within the displayed values of cells (the result of formulas or directly entered text/numbers).
    *   **Comments:** This powerful option allows you to search specifically within cell comments. For example, if you want to find all comments containing "leila," you would select **Comments** here.

    *Example of Searching in Comments:*
        *   To search for "leila" within comments, switch the "Look in" dropdown to **Comments**.
        *   Ensure "Within" is set appropriately (e.g., **Sheet** or **Workbook**).
        *   Click **Find Next** to jump to the first occurrence or **Find All** to get a comprehensive list.

        *Result:* In our example, using "Find All" when searching for "leila" in comments would reveal any comments containing that name.

*   **Find All vs. Find Next:**
    *   **Find All:**  Provides a list of *all* instances of your search term that are found, displayed in a list within the Find dialog box.
    *   **Find Next:**  Jumps to the *next* instance of your search term, one at a time.

*Example of Using "Find All" and Selecting Results:*

Let's say we search for "game" within the current sheet, looking in **Formulas** (and not in Comments).

1.  Enter "game" in the "Find what" field.
2.  Set "Within" to **Sheet**.
3.  Set "Look in" to **Formulas**.
4.  Click **Find All**.

*Result:*  The "Find All" function generates a list of all cells on the sheet where "game" appears in a formula.  The really useful feature here is that you can interact with this list:

*   **Selecting Items in the List:** You can select individual items in the list, or use **Control + Down Arrow** to select *all* items in the list.
*   **Highlighting on the Worksheet:**  Crucially, selecting items in the "Find All" list *also* highlights the corresponding cells directly on your worksheet.
*   **Applying Formatting:** With the cells highlighted from the "Find All" list, you can then easily apply formatting changes, such as changing the cell fill color to yellow or any other desired formatting.

---

**Moving to Replace Functionality**

Now, let's transition from "Find" to "Replace." We can access the **Replace** dialog box directly using a shortcut:

*   **Shortcut for Replace Dialog Box:** Press **Control + H** on your keyboard.

---

**Replacing Text and Formatting Simultaneously**

The **Replace** dialog box extends the functionality of "Find" by allowing you to not only find specific text but also replace it with something else.  Furthermore, Excel's **Replace** feature allows you to change the *formatting* during the replacement process as well.

*Example of Replacing Text and Applying Formatting:*

Let's replace every instance of "game" with "Health" on the current worksheet, and simultaneously change the cell formatting.

1.  Open the **Replace** dialog box (Control + H).
2.  In the "Find what" field, enter "game".
3.  In the "Replace with" field, enter "Health".
4.  **Formatting Options:** On the right side of the "Replace with" field, you'll see a **Format** button. Click this button.
5.  **Format Cells Dialog:** This opens the "Format Cells" dialog box, allowing you to specify the formatting you want to apply during the replacement.
    *   Go to the **Fill** tab.
    *   Select a **New Color** (e.g., a specific shade of green).
    *   Click **OK** to close the "Format Cells" dialog.
6.  Click **Replace All** to apply the replacement and formatting changes to all occurrences of "game" on the current worksheet.

*Result:* Excel will replace all instances of "game" with "Health" and simultaneously change the fill color of those cells to the selected green color. In our example, 12 replacements were made.

---

**Replacing Formatting Only: A Practical Example**

The ability to replace formatting is incredibly useful in various scenarios.  Consider a company rebranding and needing to update logo colors across many Excel files.  Let's illustrate how to replace cell colors using Find & Replace.

*Example: Replacing a Specific Blue Color with a Light Green Color*

Scenario: You have a light blue color used extensively in your worksheets, and you need to replace it with a light green color due to a company color scheme change.

1.  Open the **Replace** dialog box (Control + H).
2.  **Clear Text Fields:** Since we are only replacing formatting, delete any text in both the "Find what" and "Replace with" fields.
3.  **Specify Format to Find:** In the "Find what" section, click the **Format** dropdown button and select **Choose Format From Cell**.
4.  **Pick the Source Cell:** Your cursor will change to a pipette icon. Click on a cell that has the light blue color you want to replace. Excel will sample the formatting of this cell.
5.  **Specify Format to Replace With:** In the "Replace with" section, click the **Format** button.
    *   Go to the **Fill** tab.
    *   Select the desired **light green** color.
    *   Click **OK**.
6.  **Scope of Replacement:**  To replace the color across the entire workbook, ensure the "Within" option is set to **Workbook**.
7.  Click **Replace All**.

*Result:* Excel will search through every sheet in the workbook. Wherever it finds cells formatted with the *exact* formatting sampled from the source blue cell, it will replace the fill color with the light green color you specified. In our example, 5 replacements were made on the current sheet.

**Important Nuance: Matching All Formatting Attributes**

In the example above, you might notice that not *all* blue-filled cells were replaced.  Why? Because the "Choose Format From Cell" option is very precise. It doesn't just pick up the fill color; it captures *all* formatting attributes of the source cell, including:

*   Number formatting (e.g., percentage, number, currency)
*   Font style (e.g., bold, italics)
*   Alignment
*   And more.

If the cells you intended to replace had *any* formatting difference from the source cell (beyond just the color), they would not be matched and therefore not replaced. For example, if some blue cells were formatted as "Percentage" while your source cell was "Number," or if some were bold while the source was not, they would be skipped.

**Targeting Color Specifically for Replacement**

To ensure you *only* replace the color and ignore other formatting attributes, you need to be more precise in specifying the format to find.

*Refined Method for Color Replacement:*

1.  **Identify the Exact Color Code:** If you are unsure of the exact color code of the blue you want to replace, select a cell with that color.
    *   Go to the **Home** tab.
    *   Click the dropdown arrow next to the **Fill Color** button.
    *   Select **More Colors...**.
    *   Go to the **Custom** tab.
    *   Note down the **RGB (Red, Green, Blue)** color code displayed.

2.  **Clear Existing Find Formatting:** In the **Replace** dialog box (Control + H), if there is any formatting already set in the "Find what" section (you'll see "Format Specified" below the "Find what" field), click the **Format** dropdown and select **Clear Find Format**. This is crucial to start with a clean slate for your format search.

3.  **Specify Color by Code:** In the "Find what" section, click **Format**.
    *   Go to the **Fill** tab.
    *   Select **More Colors...**.
    *   Go to the **Custom** tab.
    *   Enter the **RGB code** you noted down earlier for the blue color you want to replace.
    *   Click **OK** in both "Color" dialogs to set the Find format.

4.  **Set the Replace Color:** Configure the "Replace with" format as before, selecting your desired light green color in the "Fill" tab.

5.  **Execute Replace All:** Ensure "Within" is set to **Workbook** if needed, and click **Replace All**.

*Result:* By specifying the color directly by its RGB code, you ensure that Excel will find *any* cell in the workbook with *that specific fill color*, regardless of other formatting attributes, and replace its fill color with the chosen light green.

---

**(Conclusion)**

As you can see, Excel's **Find & Replace** feature is far more versatile than just searching for text. The ability to search and replace formatting opens up a range of powerful possibilities, especially for tasks like bulk formatting updates and rebranding.  It's a really handy aspect of Excel that can save you significant time and effort.

## **Changing Text Case in Excel: Three Effective Methods**

**(Video URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN6BB5p6lGc)**

**(Bright Music)**

This video will demonstrate three different ways to change the case of text in Excel. Whether you need to switch from lowercase to uppercase (all caps), or clean up mixed case text to be consistently lower, upper, or proper case, this guide will cover it all. Each method has its own advantages, depending on your specific situation.

### **Method 1: Using Formulas for Case Conversion**

This section will explore how to use Excel formulas to change text case.

**Scenario:** We have a list of names with varying cases: some lowercase, some uppercase, and some in mixed case.

**Objective:**  To convert these names to different cases using formulas.

#### **1. Converting to Uppercase**

*   **Formula:** `=UPPER(cell_reference)`
    *   Replace `cell_reference` with the cell containing the text you want to convert.
    *   **Example:** `=UPPER(A1)` if the text is in cell A1.
*   **Result:**  The formula will return the text in all uppercase letters.

**Converting Formulas to Values (Optional)**

If you want to remove the formula and keep only the uppercase values:

*   **Method 1: Paste Special as Values**
    1.  **Copy** (Ctrl+C) the cells containing the uppercase formulas.
    2.  **Right-click** on the same range (or a new range where you want the values).
    3.  Select **Paste Special** and choose **Values**. This will paste only the resulting uppercase text, removing the underlying formulas.

*   **Method 2: Drag and Drop to Copy as Values**
    1.  **Highlight** the range with the uppercase formulas.
    2.  **Right-click** on the edge of the highlighted range.
    3.  **Drag** the range slightly to the side and then back to its original position.
    4.  **Release** the right mouse button.
    5.  Select **Copy Here as Values Only** from the context menu. This will replace the formulas with their resulting uppercase values.

#### **2. Converting to Lowercase**

*   **Formula:** `=LOWER(cell_reference)`
    *   Replace `cell_reference` with the cell containing the text.
    *   **Example:** `=LOWER(A1)`

#### **3. Converting to Proper Case (Sentence Case)**

*   **Formula:** `=PROPER(cell_reference)`
    *   Replace `cell_reference` with the cell containing the text.
    *   **Example:** `=PROPER(A1)`
    *   **Note:** Proper case capitalizes the first letter of each word and makes the rest lowercase.

#### **4. Removing Extra Spaces with the TRIM Function**

**Issue:**  Extra spaces within the text (e.g., double spaces, leading/trailing spaces) can affect the appearance and data processing.

**Example:** "James  Willard" (two spaces) and "Gary Miller " (space after "R").

*   **Formula:** `=TRIM(cell_reference)`
    *   Replace `cell_reference` with the cell containing the text with extra spaces.
    *   **Functionality:** The `TRIM` function removes:
        *   Extra spaces between words.
        *   Leading spaces (spaces before the first word).
        *   Trailing spaces (spaces after the last word).

**Combining TRIM with Case Conversion**

You can combine `TRIM` with case conversion formulas:

*   **Option 1: Trim after case conversion:** `=TRIM(PROPER(cell_reference))` -  First converts to proper case, then trims extra spaces.
*   **Option 2: Trim before case conversion:** `=PROPER(TRIM(cell_reference))` - First trims extra spaces, then converts to proper case. (Order might not matter for case conversion itself but could be relevant in other scenarios).

### **Method 2: Utilizing Flash Fill for Quick Case Changes**

**Flash Fill** is a powerful Excel feature that can automatically recognize patterns and apply them to other cells. It's particularly useful for one-time fixes and situations where dynamic updates are not required.

**How Flash Fill Works:**

1.  **Provide Examples:** In a column next to your text data, manually type one or two examples of how you want the case to be changed.
2.  **Initiate Flash Fill:**
    *   **Method 1: Shortcut Key:** Highlight the range where you want Flash Fill to apply the changes and press **Ctrl + E**.
    *   **Method 2: Home Tab:** Go to the **Home** tab on the Excel ribbon, find the **Fill** dropdown menu in the **Editing** group, and select **Flash Fill**.

**Flash Fill for Uppercase Example:**

1.  In the cell next to the first name (e.g., if names are in column A, start in column B), type the first name in uppercase.
2.  Highlight the range in column B where you want to apply uppercase conversion, starting from the cell you just typed in.
3.  Press **Ctrl + E**. Excel will attempt to recognize the pattern (uppercase conversion) and apply it to the rest of the names.

**Flash Fill and Extra Spaces:**

Flash Fill can sometimes recognize and remove extra spaces as part of the pattern.

**Example Demonstration:**

1.  Start with names in column A, including names with extra spaces (e.g., "James  Willard").
2.  In cell B1, type "JAMES WILLARD" (uppercase, no extra spaces).
3.  Highlight the range B1 downwards, corresponding to the names in column A.
4.  Press **Ctrl + E**.

**Result:** Flash Fill may be able to recognize the pattern of uppercase conversion *and* space removal simultaneously.

**Flash Fill for Lowercase and Proper Case:**  The process is similar for lowercase and proper case. Provide a sample in the desired case and use Flash Fill.

**Important Considerations for Flash Fill:**

*   **Static Nature:** Flash Fill results are static. If you change the original data, Flash Fill will not automatically update. You need to re-run Flash Fill if the source data changes.
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Flash Fill is generally reliable but relies on pattern recognition. In complex scenarios, it might not always correctly identify the desired pattern or might make mistakes. **Always double-check the results of Flash Fill to ensure accuracy.**

### **Method 3: Using Uppercase Fonts for Displaying Titles in Uppercase**

This method is particularly useful when you want to display titles or headings always in uppercase, regardless of how you type them.

**Concept:** Some fonts are designed to be **uppercase only**. This means they only have uppercase glyphs, and any text typed in that font will be displayed in uppercase, even if you type in lowercase.

**Identifying Uppercase Fonts:**

*   **Font List:**  Browse the font list in Excel (or any Office application).
*   **"Uppercase Only" Indication:** Look for fonts that are listed as "uppercase only" in the font dropdown menu or font selection dialog.  You can often recognize them by seeing them displayed in uppercase in the font list itself.

**Examples of Uppercase Fonts (Mentioned in the Video):**

*   **BEBAS NEUE** (and likely others available in standard Office installations or downloadable).

**Finding and Downloading Uppercase Fonts:**

*   **Font Websites:** Many websites offer free and commercial fonts, including uppercase-only fonts.
    *   **Example Website:** **dafont.com** (mentioned in the video).
*   **Usage Rights:** When downloading fonts, **always check the usage rights.** Many fonts are free for personal use, but commercial use might require a license.  Look for terms like "Free for Personal Use," "Public Domain," etc., on font websites.
*   **Installation:** After downloading a font (usually in a `.zip` file), extract the font file (e.g., `.ttf` or `.otf`). Then, typically:
    *   **Right-click** on the font file.
    *   Select **Install**.
    *   The font will be installed for all Office applications (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, etc.) and other programs on your computer.

**Using Uppercase Fonts in Excel:**

1.  **Select the Cell(s):** Choose the cell(s) where you want to display text in uppercase using an uppercase font.
2.  **Choose the Uppercase Font:** In the font dropdown menu, select the installed uppercase font (e.g., BEBAS NEUE).
3.  **Type Text:**  Type your text in the selected cell. Regardless of whether you type in lowercase, uppercase, or mixed case, the text will be displayed in uppercase due to the font.

**Example:**

1.  Select a cell.
2.  Choose the "BEBAS NEUE" font.
3.  Type "kpi report" (lowercase).
4.  The cell will display "KPI REPORT" (uppercase).

**Streamlining Font Application with Cell Styles:**

To easily apply uppercase fonts (and other formatting) to titles, you can customize **Cell Styles** in Excel.

**Customizing a Cell Style for Uppercase Fonts:**

1.  **Right-click** on a default cell style in the **Styles** group on the **Home** tab (e.g., "Heading 1").
2.  Select **Modify...**.
3.  Click the **Format...** button in the "Style" dialog box.
4.  Go to the **Font** tab.
5.  Choose your desired uppercase font (e.g., BEBAS NEUE) from the "Font" dropdown.
6.  Adjust other formatting options as needed (e.g., font size, color, border, alignment).
7.  Click **OK** in the "Format Cells" dialog box and then **OK** in the "Style" dialog box.

**Applying the Custom Cell Style:**

1.  Select the cell(s) where you want to apply the uppercase font style.
2.  Go to the **Styles** group on the **Home** tab.
3.  Click on the modified cell style (e.g., "Heading 1"). The formatting, including the uppercase font, will be applied.

**Benefits of Uppercase Fonts:**

*   **No Formulas:**  Achieves uppercase display without using formulas, keeping your worksheets cleaner.
*   **Consistent Title Case:** Ensures titles are always displayed in uppercase, regardless of input case.

**Conclusion**

**(Bright Music)**

This video has shown you three methods to change text case in Excel: formulas for dynamic conversion, Flash Fill for quick one-time adjustments, and uppercase fonts for consistent uppercase titles. Choose the method that best suits your needs to improve your Excel reports and data presentation.

## Locking and Unlocking Specific Areas in Excel Sheets: A Detailed Guide

Hello everyone, let's explore how to lock and unlock specific areas within an Excel sheet. We'll start with the basics, but today's scenario has a unique twist, stemming from a question posed by one of my students, **Anya**.

### Anya's Question: Unprotecting Specific Cells Based on Formatting

Anya asked: "I'd like to leave **yellow cells** unprotected. Is there a way to achieve this **without using a VBA macro**?  Ideally, I want to be able to move from one unprotected yellow cell to the next using the **Tab key**, as this would significantly speed up my data entry process."

So, the core question is: Can we accomplish this targeted cell unprotection without resorting to **VBA**?

*(mellow hip-hop music)*

---

## Part 1: The Basics of Worksheet Protection

Let's first revisit the fundamental methods for protecting and unprotecting your entire worksheet.

*   **Accessing Protection Options:** Navigate to the **Review tab** in the Excel ribbon.
*   **Protecting the Entire Sheet:**
    *   Click on the **"Protect Sheet"** option within the **"Protect"** group.
    *   You have the option to set a **password** to secure the protection. If you choose to use a password, you will be prompted to confirm it.
*   **Consequences of Full Protection:** Once the sheet is protected, every cell becomes locked. Attempting to input data anywhere on the sheet will result in a **popup message** indicating that the sheet is protected. Unprotection requires the password (if set).

---

## Part 2: Unprotecting Specific Cells within a Protected Sheet

Beyond full sheet protection, Excel allows for selective unprotection, enabling you to keep certain cells editable while others remain locked. There are different approaches to achieve this.

### Method 1: Utilizing "Allow Edit Ranges" (For Advanced Scenarios)

*   **"Allow Edit Ranges"** provides advanced options, including setting different passwords for distinct ranges.
*   This method is more complex and suitable for scenarios requiring varied levels of access and security across different parts of the sheet.

### Method 2:  Simple Unprotection via "Format Cells"

For a straightforward solution, we can use the **"Format Cells"** dialog box.

*   **Steps to Unprotect Specific Cells (Before Sheet Protection):**
    1.  **Select the cells** you wish to keep unprotected.
    2.  **Right-click** on the selected cells.
    3.  Choose **"Format Cells..."** from the context menu, or use the shortcut **Ctrl + 1**.
    4.  In the **"Format Cells"** dialog box, go to the **"Protection"** tab.
    5.  **Uncheck** the box next to **"Locked"**. By default, this box is checked for all cells.
    6.  Click **"OK"**.

*   **Important Note:**  Changing the "Locked" setting in "Format Cells" **does not immediately activate protection**. These settings only take effect after you protect the worksheet itself. Before sheet protection, you can still edit any cell, regardless of the "Locked" setting.

*   **Activating Protection (After Unlocking Cells):**
    1.  Go back to the **Review tab** and click **"Protect Sheet"**.
    2.  For this example, we will **not set a password**. Click **"OK"**.

*   **Testing the Protection:**
    *   Try to input data in a cell that was *not* unlocked. You will receive the protection popup.
    *   Try to input data in a cell that *was* unlocked. You should be able to edit it freely.

*   **Unlocking Multiple Areas:** You can repeat the process of selecting different cell ranges and unchecking the "Locked" option in "Format Cells" to define multiple unprotected areas within a protected sheet.

*   **Understanding the Protection Indicator:** If you revisit the **"Protection"** tab in **"Format Cells"** for a selection of cells where some are locked and some are unlocked, you will see a **symbol** in the "Locked" checkbox. This symbol indicates a **mixed state** – some cells in the selection are locked, and others are not. To revert a cell back to the default locked state, simply check the "Locked" box again.

## Part 3: The Complex Case: Unprotecting Cells Based on Formatting (Yellow Cells)

Now, let's address Anya's specific challenge: protecting all cells in a range *except* for the **yellow cells**. The yellow cells are intended to be the data input areas.

*   **Desired Behavior:** When entering data in a series of input cells in Excel, pressing the **Tab key** typically moves to the next cell in the row.  In our scenario, with gray cells protected and yellow cells unprotected, the goal is for the **Tab key** to navigate *only* through the **unprotected yellow cells**, skipping over the protected gray cells.

*   **The Challenge of Selective Unprotection:** We need to efficiently unprotect *all* yellow cells within a specified range without manually selecting each one.

---

## Part 4: Efficiently Unprotecting Yellow Cells Using the "Find" Feature

Manually selecting numerous yellow cells by holding down the **Control key** would be extremely time-consuming, especially in a large dataset.  Here's a much faster method utilizing Excel's **"Find"** feature.

*   **Steps to Unprotect Yellow Cells:**
    1.  **Highlight the entire range** where you intend to input data and which contains both protected (e.g., gray) and unprotected (yellow) cells.
    2.  Open the **"Find and Replace"** dialog box by pressing **Ctrl + F**.
    3.  Click on **"Options >>"** to expand the dialog box and reveal formatting options.
    4.  Under **"Find what:"**, click on the **"Format..."** dropdown button and select **"Choose Format From Cell..."**.
    5.  The cursor will change to a pipette icon. **Click on one of the yellow cells** in your sheet. This action samples the formatting of the yellow cell.
        *   **Important Note on Format Sampling:**  Using "Choose Format From Cell" captures the *entire* formatting of the cell, including not just the fill color but also number formats, font styles, and other formatting attributes.
    6.  Click **"Find All"**. Excel will locate all cells within the selected range that match the sampled yellow cell format. The results will be listed in the "Find and Replace" dialog box.
    7.  To select all the found yellow cells in your spreadsheet, press **Ctrl + A** while the results list is active. This will highlight all the yellow cells directly on your sheet.
    8.  Close the **"Find and Replace"** dialog box.
    9.  With all the yellow cells selected, open the **"Format Cells"** dialog box again using the shortcut **Ctrl + 1**.
    10. Go to the **"Protection"** tab.
    11. **Uncheck** the **"Locked"** box.
    12. Click **"OK"**.

---

## Part 5: Testing and Verifying the Solution

*   **Protect the Worksheet:** Go to **Review tab** and click **"Protect Sheet"**.  Do not set a password for this test. Click **"OK"**.
*   **Test Data Entry and Tab Navigation:**
    1.  Enter a number in the first yellow cell.
    2.  Press the **Tab key**.
    3.  Verify that the selection jumps to the *next* yellow cell, skipping over any gray (protected) cells.
    4.  Continue pressing **Tab** to confirm that navigation is restricted to only the yellow, unprotected cells.

This method successfully allows for efficient data entry within specifically formatted (yellow) cells while keeping other areas of the sheet protected, all without using **VBA**.

---

## Conclusion and Call to Action

This approach provides a practical solution for selectively unprotecting cells based on their formatting, enhancing data entry efficiency in Excel.

### **Introduction: The Frustration of Poor Excel Printouts**

We've all seen it happen in companies time and again. An important Excel report, urgently needed by management, is sent via email.  The recipient opens the file, clicks print to get a hard copy for the manager, and then... disaster strikes. The printed report is a mess.

Imagine this scenario:

*   **Column headings only on the first page:**  Subsequent pages lack context, making the report difficult to understand.
*   **Missing page numbers:**  Impossible to tell if pages are missing or in the correct order.
*   **Important data missing from print:**  Crucial parts of the spreadsheet simply fail to appear on paper.

Managers end up in meetings, frustrated and struggling with these poorly printed reports. This is not only annoying but also inefficient.

**The Good News:**  This frustration is easily avoidable!  By optimizing your Excel sheets for printing, you can prevent these issues and save valuable resources. Let's explore how to achieve perfect Excel printouts.

### **Understanding Default Excel Print Settings and Why You Should Change Them**

Excel's **default print settings** are often not ideal for your needs.

*   **Default Orientation:**  Excel defaults to **portrait** orientation.
*   **Data Width:** Your data sets are frequently wider than they are tall.
*   **Automatic Page Breaks:** Excel automatically inserts page breaks based on:
    *   Paper size
    *   Scale options
    *   Margin settings

**Key Point:** You can and likely *should* adjust these settings before printing to get the desired output.

---

### **Navigating Print Preview and Accessing Printing Options**

Let's explore how to access and utilize Excel's printing options.

**1. Using the Quick Access Toolbar:**

*   Look for the **Print Preview and Print** option in your **Quick Access Toolbar**.
*   **If it's not visible:**
    *   Click the dropdown arrow in the Quick Access Toolbar.
    *   Select **Print Preview and Print** from the dropdown menu to add it.
*   **Clicking the icon:**  Directly opens the printing options interface.

**2. Accessing via the File Menu:**

*   Go to **File** in the Excel Ribbon.
*   Select **Print**.

**Initial Observation in Print Preview:**

*   Upon entering Print Preview, immediately assess how your report will be printed.
*   In the example shown, the report initially spans **two pages**, which is undesirable.

**Goal:**  To fit the report onto a single page.

**Adjustments:** You can make print adjustments in two locations:

*   **Directly within the Print Preview view.**
*   **By navigating back to the worksheet** and making adjustments there.

Both locations offer similar options; choose the method you find most comfortable.

---

### **Making Adjustments in Print Preview: Margins, Orientation, and Scaling**

Let's explore making adjustments directly in the Print Preview interface.

**1. Adjusting Margins:**

*   In Print Preview, locate the **Margins** dropdown.
*   Change from **Normal** to **Narrow** margins to gain more space on the page.
*   **Observation:** In the example, even with narrow margins, the report still spans two pages.

**2. Changing Orientation:**

*   In Print Preview, find the **Orientation** dropdown.
*   Switch from **Portrait** to **Landscape** orientation if your data is wider.
*   **Observation:** In the example, landscape orientation doesn't solve the two-page issue.

**3. Scaling to Fit on One Page:**

*   In Print Preview, locate the **Scaling** dropdown.
*   Select **"Fit Sheet on One Page"**.
*   **Result:** This setting forces the entire sheet to print on a single page by automatically reducing the scale.

---

### **Exploring Printing Options in Page Layout View**

The **Page Layout** tab in the Excel Ribbon provides another access point to printing options, offering further customization.

**Accessing Page Setup from Page Layout:**

*   Go to the **Page Layout** tab on the Excel Ribbon.
*   The **Page Setup** group contains key printing options, mirroring some of those in the Print Preview "backstage view."
*   Click the **small tilted arrow** in the bottom right corner of the **Page Setup** group to open the **Page Setup dialog box**.

**Page Setup Dialog Box - Additional Options:**

*   This dialog box reveals more advanced options that are not immediately visible in the ribbon.
*   **Margins Tab - Centering on Page:**
    *   A highly useful feature located in the **Margins** tab of the Page Setup dialog box.
    *   **Default Centering:**  Reports are typically centered at the top-left of the page.
    *   **Centering Options:**
        *   **Horizontally:** Centers the report left-to-right on the page.
        *   **Vertically:** Centers the report top-to-bottom on the page.
        *   **Result:**  Positions the report in the true center of the paper.
    *   **Accessing Margins Tab from Print Preview:**  The Page Setup dialog box, including the Margins tab, can also be accessed from the Print Preview's **"Custom Scaling Options"** link.

**Sheet Tab - Gridlines and Scaling Percentage:**

*   **Gridlines:**
    *   **Default Behavior:** Gridlines are *not* printed by default.
    *   **To Print Gridlines:** In the **Sheet** tab of the Page Setup dialog box, check the **"Print"** checkbox under **"Gridlines"**.
    *   **Visual Confirmation in Print Preview:** Gridlines will now be visible in the Print Preview.
*   **Scale Percentage:**
    *   The **Sheet** tab also displays the **Scale Percentage**.
    *   **Understanding Scale:** When "Fit Sheet on One Page" is selected, Excel shrinks the content, resulting in a lower scale percentage.
    *   **Readability Consideration:**  Avoid excessive shrinking, which can make the text too small to read.

---

### **Improving Scale Percentage: Reducing Content**

How to increase the scale percentage for better readability:

*   **Adjust Margins:** Narrow margins offer a limited increase.
*   **Reduce Report Size:**  The most effective way to increase the scale percentage is to condense the report's content.
    *   **Hide Unnecessary Rows or Columns:** Remove any data that is not essential for the printed report.
    *   **Condensing Data:** The more compact the report becomes, the higher the scale percentage will be, improving readability at the printed size.
    *   **Example:** Hiding unnecessary rows or columns can increase the scale from, for instance, 80% to 82% or higher.

---

### **Printing Specific Parts of a Worksheet: Print Selection and Print Area**

Excel offers methods to print only selected portions of your worksheet.

**1. Printing a Selection (One-Time Print):**

*   **Scenario:** You need to print only specific columns (e.g., "list of apps" and "sales for 2019").
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Highlight the desired area** you want to print.
    *   Go to **File > Print**.
    *   In the Print Settings, change the **"Print Active Sheets"** dropdown to **"Print Selection"**.
    *   **Print Preview Update:** The Print Preview will now only show the selected area.
    *   **Page Count:** The report will be limited to the selected content, potentially printing on fewer pages (e.g., "1 of 1").

**2. Setting a Print Area (Permanent Selection):**

*   **Scenario:** You want to *always* print only specific columns whenever someone prints the sheet, without needing to manually select each time.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Highlight the area** you want to permanently define as the print area.
    *   Go to the **Page Layout** tab.
    *   In the **Page Setup** group, click on **"Print Area"**.
    *   Select **"Set Print Area"**.
    *   **Effect:** Excel now remembers this defined print area.
    *   **Subsequent Print Actions:**  Whenever anyone goes to print (File > Print or Quick Access button), only the defined print area will be printed, regardless of whether they select "Print Selection" or "Print Active Sheets".  Excel treats the active sheet *as* only the defined print area.
    *   **Ignoring Other Content:**  Content outside the print area is completely ignored for printing purposes.

**3. Clearing a Print Area:**

*   To revert to printing the entire sheet, you need to clear the set print area.
*   Go to **Page Layout > Print Area > Clear Print Area**.

---

### **Controlling Page Breaks for Multi-Page Reports**

For reports that span multiple pages, Excel's automatic page breaks might not always be ideal. You can manually control page breaks.

**Scenario:** Printing a document with a table on one page and two charts on separate pages.

**Initial Attempt - Scale to Fit:**

*   Using **"Fit Sheet on One Page"** results in a very low scale percentage and makes the report unreadable.
*   Trying **"Fit all columns on one page"** and setting height to "2 pages" might still not arrange the content as desired.

**Manual Page Breaks:**

*   To precisely control page breaks, you can insert them manually.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Go to the **Page Layout** tab.
    *   In the **Page Setup** group, click on **"Breaks"**.
    *   Select **"Insert Page Break"**.
    *   **Placement:** Insert the page break *above* the row where you want the new page to start.
    *   **Example:** To separate the table from the charts, insert a page break below the table.

**Refining Page Breaks with Page Break Preview:**

*   **Access Page Break Preview:** Go to the **View** tab and click on **"Page Break Preview"**.
*   **Visual Representation:** Page Break Preview displays:
    *   **Solid Blue Borders:** Indicate page breaks you've manually inserted.
    *   **Dashed Blue Lines:** Show page breaks automatically set by Excel.
*   **Adjusting Page Breaks:**
    *   **Drag and Drop:** You can drag the blue page break lines to reposition them.
    *   **Fine-Tuning Layout:** Adjust page breaks to ensure charts or tables are not split across pages and content fits neatly.
    *   **Example:** Drag a vertical page break to ensure a chart is fully included on a page, not cut off. Also, adjust horizontal page breaks to ensure charts are on separate pages as intended.

**Returning to Normal View:**

*   After adjusting page breaks in Page Break Preview, return to **Normal View** (View tab > Normal).
*   **Page Break Indicators in Normal View:** You will now see dotted lines in Normal View indicating the page breaks you've set.

**Final Print Preview Check:**

*   After adjusting page breaks, always check **Print Preview** again (File > Print) to confirm the layout is exactly as desired before printing.

### **Introduction: The Problem of Missing Headers in Printed Excel Spreadsheets**

I'm sure this is something you've come across before. You have a big report in a worksheet in Excel, like this one.  Now, when you print the spreadsheet, you only get the headers on the **first page**.

*   On all the following pages, you now have to guess which column header the number belongs to.
*   It's very inconvenient to always flip back to the first page to find out what column 10, row 20 refers to.

### **Solution: Repeating Rows and Columns on Every Page**

Fortunately, there is a handy little feature in Excel that lets you automatically **repeat rows as well as columns** on every page of your printout or your PDF document. Let me show you.

### **Demonstration: Repeating Headers in a Profit Development Report**

So here, I have some sample profit development data for these apps. They go from January 2019 all the way to December 2020.

*   Notice they take up a lot of space in the rows as well as the columns.
*   If I go to **print preview**, this is going to print on four pages, which is not bad.
*   But check this out, on the last page here, I have no clue what this 800 belongs to.
*   I need to get the headers on both the row side as well as the column side repeated on each single page.

### **Accessing Page Setup Options**

There is an option for this. Let's go to **page layout** to **page setup**, and let's go to **more options** here.

### **Setting Rows and Columns to Repeat**

Select **sheet**. Right here, we need to select the **rows to repeat on the top**.

*   Whatever we select here is going to be repeated on every single page.
*   We definitely want to have our months there.
*   We also want to get our **columns repeated** because, remember, on the last page, we don't see the columns either.

### **Verifying Header Repetition in Print Preview**

Now let's go back to **print preview** and see how this looks.

*   **First page:** is nice.
*   **Second page:** we get our headers here.
*   **Third page:** we get our headers and we get our columns repeated.
*   **Last page:** we know what that 800 belongs to.

### **Refining the Print Area to Remove Unwanted Content**

Now one thing I don't like about this is this page here, where I selected the entire column, I can also see that writing that I had on top. Now I don't want this in my report, it's enough to see profit development. So how can I get rid of that without deleting it? I can set my **print areas**.

*   I'm just going to highlight the data only and the header that I want.
*   Go to **print area**, and **set it**.

### **Reviewing the Refined Print Area in Print Preview**

Now let's go to **Print Preview**. This page looks great and everything fits properly.

### **Adding Page Numbers for Multi-Page Documents**

Now one adjustment to this is to add **page numbers**. So whenever you're printing something that's more than two pages, it's good practice to add page numbers to it.

### **Accessing Page Layout View**

Now you can do it really quickly by going to **page layout view**. There are different ways we can get there. A fast way is to go down here and click on **page layout**.

*   So this is the default, it's the **normal view**.
*   This is the **page layout view**.
*   In this view, you can see how your printed page is going to look and you can easily add headers and footers.

### **Adding Page Numbers in the Footer**

So let's just click here to activate the **header and footer options**. You can type directly in there, and you can use some of these elements that are directly available.

*   **Header and Footer Elements:**
    *   File path
    *   File name
    *   Logo
    *   Current date
    *   Current time

Now to add the page numbers, we need these two, let's do that in the footer. So I'm just going to scroll down here, go back to **header and footer** and click on **page number**. It's also nice to see how many pages are in total. So I'm going to add a space, type of, and put in **number of pages**. So this way I see the current page and how many pages there are in total.

### **Returning to Normal View**

How do I go back to **normal view**? I just have to click here. Another way of getting there is to go to the **view tab** here.

*   Notice we're on **page layout**.
*   I can switch to **normal view** also here.

### **Final Print Preview with Page Numbers**

Now let's go back to **print preview** and we see one of four, two of four, and four of four.

**Understanding VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP Functions**

The primary purpose of both **VLOOKUP** and **HLOOKUP** functions is to search for a specific value within a large data table and retrieve a corresponding value from the same row.

**Key Principles for Both Functions:**

*   **Lookup Column/Row Position:** The value you are searching for **must** be located in the **leftmost column** (for VLOOKUP) or the **topmost row** (for HLOOKUP) of your data table.
*   **Return Value Location:** The value you want to retrieve must be in a column to the **right** of the lookup column (for VLOOKUP) or in a row **below** the lookup row (for HLOOKUP).  This means you cannot use these functions to look up a value on the right side and return a value on the left side.

**Distinguishing VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP:**

*   **VLOOKUP (Vertical Lookup):** Used when your data table has **column headers**, and your data is arranged in columns.
*   **HLOOKUP (Horizontal Lookup):** Used when your data table has **row headers**, and your data is arranged in rows.

Let's explore examples of each function to understand them better.

---

**VLOOKUP in Detail: Vertical Lookup**

**Example Scenario:** Imagine you have a dataset containing sales information for different agents, including:

*   **Sales Agent**
*   **Quantity Sold**
*   **Revenue**
*   **Price**
*   **Customer**

Your goal is to create a summary report where you can select a sales agent and automatically retrieve their corresponding **price** and **customer** from the data table.

**Step 1: Creating a Drop-Down List for Agent Selection (Data Validation)**

As a preliminary step, we'll create a drop-down list to easily select agents. This utilizes the data validation feature:

1.  Go to the **Data** tab in your spreadsheet program.
2.  Click on **Data Validation**.
3.  In the Data Validation dialog box, under the **Allow** dropdown, select **List**.
4.  In the **Source** field, specify the range containing your list of agents.  You can quickly select this range by:
    *   Clicking in the Source field.
    *   Selecting the first agent in your list.
    *   Pressing **Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow Key** to select all agents in the column.
5.  Click **OK**.

Now you have a drop-down list where you can choose a sales agent.

**Step 2: Using VLOOKUP to Find the Price**

We will now use the **VLOOKUP** formula to automatically find the price associated with the selected agent.

*   **Formula:**  `=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])`

Let's break down each argument in the formula within our example:

*   **`lookup_value`**:  This is the value you want to search for. In our case, it's the **selected agent** from the drop-down list (e.g., cell containing the agent name).
*   **`table_array`**: This is the **entire data table** where you want to look up the value and retrieve the corresponding information.  It's crucial to select the complete range that includes:
    *   The **lookup column** (Sales Agent column in our example, which *must* be the leftmost column of your selection).
    *   All columns to the right that contain the data you might want to retrieve (Quantity, Revenue, Price, Customer).
    *   **Important:** Select the entire contiguous range; do not select disjointed ranges. Even if you don't need columns like "Quantity" and "Revenue" for this specific lookup, you still need to include them in your `table_array` if they are positioned between the lookup column and the columns you *do* need (like "Price" and "Customer").
*   **`col_index_num`**: This is the **column index number** within your `table_array` that contains the value you want to return. The leftmost column of your `table_array` is considered column 1, the next column to the right is column 2, and so on. To find the **Price**, we need to count the columns from the "Sales Agent" column (which is column 1 in our selected table range) to the "Price" column. In our example, "Price" is in the **4th column**. So, we will use `4` as the `col_index_num`.
*   **`[range_lookup]`**: This is an optional argument that specifies whether you want an exact match or an approximate match.
    *   If left **empty** or set to **TRUE**:  **Approximate match** is assumed. This requires your lookup column (Sales Agent column) to be sorted in ascending order. If not sorted, you might get incorrect results or errors.
    *   If set to **FALSE**: **Exact match** is required. This is generally recommended, especially when working with text values like agent names. It ensures you get the value corresponding to the exact agent name you are looking for.

    **Recommendation:**  It's generally best practice to always use **`FALSE`** for the `range_lookup` argument to ensure you are getting an exact match, especially when dealing with text lookups. This avoids potential issues related to data sorting and ensures accuracy.

**Applying VLOOKUP for Price in our Example:**

Assuming your selected agent is in cell `B1` and your data table range is `A2:E10`, the formula to find the price would be:

`=VLOOKUP(B1, A2:E10, 4, FALSE)`

**Step 3: Using VLOOKUP to Find the Customer**

We can follow the same logic to find the customer associated with the selected agent. The only change is the `col_index_num` because the "Customer" column is in a different position within our `table_array`.

*   The "Customer" column is the **5th column** in our selected table range (A2:E10).

**Applying VLOOKUP for Customer:**

Using the same assumptions as above, the formula to find the customer would be:

`=VLOOKUP(B1, A2:E10, 5, FALSE)`

Now, as you select different agents from the drop-down list, the formulas will dynamically update to show the corresponding price and customer for that agent.

---

**Using VLOOKUP Within Other Formulas**

**VLOOKUP** is not limited to being used as a standalone formula. It can be incorporated within other formulas to perform calculations or more complex lookups.

**Example: Calculating Price when Price is Not Directly Available**

Let's say your original data source *doesn't* directly provide the "Price," but you have "Revenue" and "Quantity Sold." You can calculate the price by dividing Revenue by Quantity.  We can use **VLOOKUP** to retrieve the Revenue and Quantity for a selected agent and then perform the division.

**Formula to Calculate Price using VLOOKUP:**

`=(VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, revenue_col_index, FALSE)) / (VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, quantity_col_index, FALSE))`

**Breakdown:**

1.  **`VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, revenue_col_index, FALSE)`**: This part uses VLOOKUP to find the "Revenue" for the selected agent. You need to replace `revenue_col_index` with the correct column number for the "Revenue" column in your `table_array`.
2.  **`VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, quantity_col_index, FALSE)`**: This part uses VLOOKUP to find the "Quantity Sold" for the same selected agent. Replace `quantity_col_index` with the column number for the "Quantity Sold" column.
3.  **`(...) / (...)`**: The results of the two VLOOKUP formulas are then divided to calculate the price.

**Example Formula (assuming Revenue is in column 3 and Quantity in column 2 of your `table_array`):**

`=(VLOOKUP(B1, A2:E10, 3, FALSE)) / (VLOOKUP(B1, A2:E10, 2, FALSE))`

This demonstrates the flexibility of **VLOOKUP** in being used as a component within more complex formulas to perform calculations based on looked-up values.

**HLOOKUP in Detail: Horizontal Lookup**

**Scenario: Data in Rows (Transposed Data)**

In some cases, your data might be provided in a transposed format, where headers are in rows instead of columns.  In this scenario, you would use **HLOOKUP**.

**Example: Transposed Sales Data**

Imagine your sales data is structured like this:

| Header        | Agent A | Agent B | Agent C | Agent D | ... |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-----|
| Sales Agent   | Agent A | Agent B | Agent C | Agent D | ... |
| Quantity Sold | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | ... |
| Revenue       | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | ... |
| Price         | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | ... |
| Customer      | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | ... |

Here, the headers ("Sales Agent", "Quantity Sold", "Revenue", "Price", "Customer") are in the **first row**, and the data for each agent is in subsequent rows.

**Step 1: Creating a Drop-Down List (Same as VLOOKUP)**

You would create a drop-down list for agent selection in the same way as described in the VLOOKUP example (using Data Validation).

**Step 2: Using HLOOKUP to Find the Price**

*   **Formula:** `=HLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, row_index_num, [range_lookup])`

The arguments are similar to VLOOKUP, but with a focus on rows instead of columns:

*   **`lookup_value`**: The agent selected from the drop-down list.
*   **`table_array`**: The entire data table range.  **Crucially**, the **first row** of your `table_array` must contain the **lookup row** (in this case, the "Sales Agent" row).
*   **`row_index_num`**: The **row index number** within your `table_array` that contains the value you want to return. The topmost row of your `table_array` is row 1, the next row below is row 2, and so on. To find the "Price," count the rows from the "Sales Agent" row (row 1) down to the "Price" row. In this example, "Price" is in the **4th row**. So, use `4`.
*   **`[range_lookup]`**:  Same as in VLOOKUP – use **`FALSE`** for exact match (recommended).

**Applying HLOOKUP for Price in Transposed Data:**

Assuming your selected agent is in cell `B1` and your transposed data table range is `A1:F6`, the formula to find the price would be:

`=HLOOKUP(B1, A1:F6, 4, FALSE)`

**Step 3: Using HLOOKUP to Find the Customer**

Similarly, to find the customer, the only change is the `row_index_num`. The "Customer" row is the **5th row**.

**Applying HLOOKUP for Customer:**

`=HLOOKUP(B1, A1:F6, 5, FALSE)`

**Step 4: Finding Quantity using HLOOKUP**

If you wanted to find the "Quantity Sold" instead of "Price" or "Customer," you would simply change the `row_index_num` to correspond to the "Quantity Sold" row. In this example, "Quantity Sold" is in the **2nd row**.

**Applying HLOOKUP for Quantity:**

`=HLOOKUP(B1, A1:F6, 2, FALSE)`

---

**Key Limitation of VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP: Left-Look Restriction**

A significant limitation of both **VLOOKUP** and **HLOOKUP** is that they **cannot look to the left**.

**The Lookup Value Must Be in the Leftmost Column/Topmost Row:**

*   For **VLOOKUP**, the value you are searching for *must* be in the **leftmost column** of your `table_array`.  You can only retrieve values from columns to the *right* of the lookup column.
*   For **HLOOKUP**, the value you are searching for *must* be in the **topmost row** of your `table_array`. You can only retrieve values from rows *below* the lookup row.

**Example of the Limitation:**

Imagine you wanted to reverse the lookup. Instead of selecting an agent and finding the customer, you wanted to select a **customer** and find the corresponding **agent**.

Using standard **VLOOKUP** or **HLOOKUP**, you **cannot** directly achieve this if your original data table is structured with "Sales Agent" in the leftmost column and "Customer" to its right.

**Workaround for Left-Look Requirement:**

To perform a "left-look" lookup with VLOOKUP or HLOOKUP, you would need to **restructure your data table**.  Specifically, you would have to:

*   Move the **"Customer" column to the leftmost position** if you want to look up customers and retrieve agents using VLOOKUP.
*   Move the **"Customer" row to the topmost position** if you want to look up customers and retrieve agents using HLOOKUP.

By ensuring the column or row you are searching by is always the leftmost or topmost in your `table_array`, you can effectively use VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP for your lookup needs, while being mindful of their inherent "right-look" and "down-look" orientation.

# **Understanding Excel Formulas and Functions: A Beginner's Guide**

**(Video URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1126PQ5zRU)**

**(Playful upbeat music)**

This video will guide you through the essential formulas and functions in Excel. It's designed for **Excel beginners** and those who want to gain more confidence in using functions. We'll also explore a helpful trick to simplify using any function in Excel. Let's get started!

## **1. Getting Started with Basic Formulas**

We will be using a sample dataset containing **Name**, **Department**, and **Salary** to demonstrate these concepts.

In Excel, every formula begins with an **equal sign (=)**.

To perform basic calculations:

*   Start by typing **"="** in a cell.
*   Select a cell using your **mouse** or **arrow keys**.
*   Enter a mathematical operator (e.g., **+**, **-**, **\***, **/**).
*   Select another cell.
*   Press **Enter** to see the result.

**Example: Adding and Subtracting Numbers**

1.  Select a cell and type **=**.
2.  Select the first number cell.
3.  Type **+** (plus sign).
4.  Select the second number cell.
5.  Press **Enter**.

    *   You can continue adding more operations like **-** (minus sign) followed by another cell to subtract.
    *   Pressing **Enter** after completing your formula will display the calculated result in the cell.

**Dynamic Nature of Formulas:**

*   Excel formulas are dynamic. If you change any of the values in the cells referenced in your formula, the result will **automatically update**.
*   Use **Control + Z** to undo actions if needed.

**Multiplication and Division:**

*   **Division:** Use the **slash (/)** sign to divide.
    *   Example: `=Cell1/Cell2`
*   **Multiplication:** Use the **asterisk (\*)** sign to multiply.
    *   Example: `=Cell1\*Cell2`

**Using Brackets (Parentheses) for Order of Operations:**

*   You can use **brackets ( )** to control the order of operations in your formulas, just like in mathematics.
    *   Example: `=(Cell1+Cell2)/Cell3` - This will first add `Cell1` and `Cell2`, and then divide the result by `Cell3`.

## **2. Introduction to Excel Functions: The SUM Function**

For more complex calculations, especially when dealing with ranges of data, **Excel functions** are incredibly useful.

*   **Functions** are pre-programmed tools designed to perform specific tasks.
*   Instead of manually adding many numbers with plus signs, you can use a function like **SUM**.

**Example: Using the SUM Function to Add a Range of Salaries**

1.  Select a cell where you want the sum to appear.
2.  Type **=SUM**. As you type, a list of functions will appear.
3.  Select **SUM** from the list using your **mouse** or the **Tab key**.  Using **Tab** will auto-complete the function name and open the bracket `(`.
4.  Select the range of cells you want to sum. You can do this by:
    *   Clicking and dragging with your **mouse**.
    *   Using the **arrow keys** while holding down the **Shift key**.
5.  Close the bracket **)**.
6.  Press **Enter**.

    *   The cell will now display the sum of all the values in the selected range.

**Explanation of Functions:**

*   Functions are like "programmed machines" that perform specific tasks.
*   The **SUM function** specifically adds up values.
*   Another example is the **COUNT function**, which counts values (we'll see this shortly).

## **3. Discovering and Using Functions: The Formulas Tab and Insert Function Feature**

**Finding Functions:**

*   If you are new to Excel, you might not know the names of all the functions.
*   Excel provides tools to help you find and understand functions.

**Using the Formulas Tab:**

*   Navigate to the **Formulas tab** in the Excel ribbon.
*   This tab is dedicated to working with formulas and functions.

**Insert Function Feature:**

*   Within the **Formulas tab**, click on **Insert Function**.
*   This opens the **Insert Function dialog box**, which helps you find and understand functions.

**Example: Finding the SUM Function using Insert Function**

1.  Click on **Insert Function** in the **Formulas tab**.
2.  In the "Search for a function" box, type a keyword describing what you want to do. For example, type **add values**.
3.  Press **Enter** or click **Go**.
4.  Excel will display a list of suggested functions based on your keyword.
5.  Select a function from the list (e.g., **SUM**).
6.  The dialog box will display information about the function, including its purpose and syntax.
    *   For **SUM**, it will say something like: "Adds all the numbers in a range of cells."

7.  For now, click **Cancel** to close the **Insert Function** dialog box (we will revisit it later for a more complex function).

## **4. AutoSum: A Quick and Easy Way to Use Common Functions**

**AutoSum Feature:**

*   **AutoSum** is a very convenient feature for quickly inserting common functions like **SUM**, **AVERAGE**, **COUNT**, etc.
*   You can find **AutoSum** in two locations:
    *   **Formulas Tab**:  Look for the **AutoSum** button in the **Function Library** group.
    *   **Home Tab**:  On the **Home tab**, in the **Editing** group, you will also find **AutoSum**.

**Using the AutoSum Dropdown:**

1.  Select the cell where you want the result.
2.  Click the **dropdown arrow** next to **AutoSum** (either in the **Formulas** or **Home** tab).
3.  A list of common functions will appear (**Sum**, **Average**, **Count**, **Max**, **Min**, etc.).
4.  Select the function you need (e.g., **Sum**).
5.  Excel will automatically attempt to select a range of cells to apply the function to.
6.  **Verify the selected range**: Check if the highlighted range is correct. If not, you can adjust it by dragging your mouse or using arrow keys.
7.  Press **Enter** to apply the function.

**AutoSum Shortcut: Alt + =**

*   There's a keyboard shortcut for **AutoSum** (specifically for the **SUM** function).
*   Select the cell where you want the sum.
*   Press and hold the **Alt key** and then press the **equals sign (=)**.  (**Alt + =**)
*   Excel will automatically insert the **SUM** function and attempt to select a range.
*   Verify and adjust the range if needed, and then press **Enter**.

**Horizontal AutoSum:**

*   **AutoSum** also works horizontally. If you have numbers in a row, you can use **Alt + =** in a cell to the right of the numbers, and it will automatically sum the row.

## **5. Exploring Commonly Used Excel Functions: SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, COUNTA, MIN, MAX**

Let's explore some of the most frequently used functions in Excel:

| Function Name | Description                                           | Example Use in this Context                                  |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SUM**       | Adds all numbers in a range of cells.                  | Totaling all salaries.                                        |
| **AVERAGE**   | Calculates the average of numbers in a range.          | Finding the average salary.                                   |
| **COUNT**     | Counts the number of cells in a range that contain numbers. | Counting the number of employees with salary information.     |
| **COUNTA**    | Counts the number of cells in a range that are not empty. | Counting the total number of employees (regardless of salary). |
| **MIN**       | Finds the smallest number in a range.                 | Identifying the minimum salary.                               |
| **MAX**       | Finds the largest number in a range.                  | Identifying the maximum salary.                               |

**Demonstrations of Each Function:**

**a) SUM Function: Adding Values**

*   We've already seen how to use **SUM** with **AutoSum** and by typing `=SUM()`.
*   It adds up all numerical values within the specified range.

**b) AVERAGE Function: Calculating Average**

1.  In a cell, type `=AVERAGE(`.
2.  Select the range of salary cells.
3.  Close the bracket `)`.
4.  Press **Enter**.

    *   **Important Note**: When using **AutoSum > Average**, be careful as it might include cells above or to the side that you don't want to average. Always double-check and adjust the selected range if necessary. For example, it might mistakenly include a cell containing the word "Sum" or "Average" if it's located directly above the intended data range.

**c) COUNT Function: Counting Numbers**

1.  In a cell, type `=COUNT(`.
2.  Select the range of salary cells.
3.  Close the bracket `)`.
4.  Press **Enter**.

    *   **COUNT** function only counts cells that contain **numbers**. If a cell in the range is empty or contains text, it will not be counted.
    *   If salary information is missing for an employee (cell is empty or contains text), the **COUNT** will be lower.

**d) COUNTA Function: Counting Non-Empty Cells**

1.  In a cell, type `=COUNTA(`.
2.  Select the range of **Name** cells (or any column where you expect data for every employee).
3.  Close the bracket `)`.
4.  Press **Enter**.

    *   **COUNTA** function counts all cells that are **not empty**, regardless of whether they contain text or numbers.
    *   It's useful for counting items in a list where you want to count all entries, not just numerical values.

**e) MIN Function: Finding Minimum Value**

1.  In a cell, type `=MIN(`.
2.  Select the range of salary cells.
3.  Close the bracket `)`.
4.  Press **Enter**.

    *   **MIN** function finds the smallest numerical value in the selected range.

**f) MAX Function: Finding Maximum Value**

1.  In a cell, type `=MAX(`.
2.  Select the range of salary cells.
3.  Close the bracket `)`.
4.  Press **Enter**.

    *   **MAX** function finds the largest numerical value in the selected range.

## **6. Advanced Functions: Conditional Average using AVERAGEIFS**

**Scenario: Calculating Average Salary by Department**

*   What if you want to find the average salary for employees in a specific department, like "Sales"?
*   For this, you need a conditional function, and Excel provides functions like **AVERAGEIF** and **AVERAGEIFS**.

**Understanding AVERAGEIF and AVERAGEIFS:**

*   **AVERAGEIF**: Calculates the average for a range that meets a single criterion (condition).
*   **AVERAGEIFS**: Calculates the average for a range that meets **multiple criteria** (conditions). It's more flexible for complex scenarios.

**Using AVERAGEIFS for Average Sales Department Salary**

1.  In a cell, type `=AVERAGE` to see function options.
2.  Select **AVERAGEIFS** from the list (or type it fully).
3.  Open the **Insert Function** dialog box for easier understanding and input. You can do this by:
    *   Clicking the **"fx"** button next to the formula bar.
    *   Clicking **Insert Function** in the **Formulas tab**.

4.  The **Function Arguments** dialog box for **AVERAGEIFS** will appear. It asks for:
    *   **Average_range**:  "The actual cells to be used to find the average." - This is the range containing the salaries (the numbers we want to average). Select the salary column.
    *   **Criteria_range1**: "The range of cells you want evaluated for the first condition." - This is the range containing the departments. Select the department column.
    *   **Criteria1**: "The condition or criteria in the form of a number, expression, or text that defines which cells will be used to find the average." - This is the department we are interested in, which is "Sales". You can:
        *   Type **"Sales"** directly in the box (remember to use quotation marks for text in formulas). Excel will automatically add quotation marks if you type `Sales` and then click in another box.
        *   Reference a cell that contains the text "Sales" if you have it in your spreadsheet.

5.  **Preview Result**:  As you fill in the arguments, the dialog box will show you a **Formula result** at the bottom. This allows you to check if your function is likely to work correctly before you even press **OK**.

6.  Click **OK** to insert the **AVERAGEIFS** function into your cell.

    *   The cell will now display the average salary for employees in the Sales department.

**Benefits of using Insert Function Dialog Box:**

*   It provides clear descriptions of each argument for a function.
*   It shows a preview of the result, helping you understand if your function is working as expected.
*   It's especially helpful for complex functions like **AVERAGEIFS** when you're learning or unsure of the exact syntax.

## **7. Conclusion and Further Learning**

This introduction covered fundamental Excel formulas and essential functions like **SUM**, **AVERAGE**, **COUNT**, **COUNTA**, **MIN**, **MAX**, and conditional functions like **AVERAGEIFS**.

*   Excel has a vast library of functions for various tasks and analyses.

**Introduction: Excel Interview Questions - What to Expect**

Video URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNXqJ-n92U4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNXqJ-n92U4)

Good **Excel** knowledge is often a job requirement these days. However, the definition of "good" or "advanced" knowledge can vary greatly.  Many employers address this by asking specific **Excel** questions during interviews. This video aims to help you prepare for these types of questions.

**Background and Community Survey**

To provide context, the video creator previously asked their community to share:

*   **Excel** questions they were asked when applying for jobs.
*   **Excel** questions they asked as interviewers.

The responses were summarized based on the different positions people were applying for. The results were surprising, as the most common questions were not the initially expected ones like **VLOOKUP** or understanding dollar signs in cell references.

**Key Topics to Focus On**

The following sections will detail the types of questions to expect, helping you focus your preparation.  Please note that this video cannot provide answers to all questions as that would require beginner, advanced, and super-advanced level content.  Instead, links to resources covering most of the discussed topics have been added to the video description. For more structured learning and hands-on practice, consider taking a dedicated course.

---

**Surprising Common Topics Across Positions**

Regardless of the specific position (e.g., Data Analyst, Financial Analyst, Project Manager, Systems Accountant), two topics were consistently and frequently tested:

*   **Pivot Tables**
*   **Removing Duplicates**

These were followed by:

*   **Lookup Functions**, specifically **VLOOKUP**
*   **SUMIFS**, **COUNTIFS**, **AVERAGEIFS** functions
*   **Nested IF Functions** (emphasis on the "nested" aspect, not just basic **IF** functions)

These are considered crucial topics to master for a wide range of roles.

---

**How Excel Knowledge is Assessed in Interviews**

Interviewers typically use a combination of indirect and direct methods to assess **Excel** proficiency.

**1. Indirect Assessment:**

*   **Example Question:** "What's your experience using Microsoft Excel to manipulate and analyze data?" (This question was asked to a Logistics Planner applicant at Amazon).

    *   **Interviewer's Goal:**  They want to hear about your use of **Pivot Tables**, data cleaning techniques, and complex **Excel** functions/features used to create reports.
    *   **Important Note:** Simply mentioning features is insufficient. You should demonstrate actual experience in creating reports and using the features you discuss.

**2. Direct Assessment (Excel Tests):**

*   **Interviewer Perspective:**  One interviewer stated they ask, "How do people use Excel in their current or previous position?" They are particularly interested in hearing about **Excel's** use in reporting and consider mentioning **Pivot Tables** a significant positive.
*   **Excel Test Example:**  Following the interview portion, a common practice is to administer an **Excel** test. This test might include exercises like:
    *   **Sorting**
    *   **Pivot Tables** creation
    *   Creating a **Basic Chart** from a data table
    *   Entering **Simple Calculations** alongside data
    *   **Filtering** and **Totaling** to get results

    *   **Test Evaluation:** Interviewers can easily assess a candidate's **Excel** skill level and approach based on their test performance.
    *   **Time Limit:**  A typical time limit for such tests is around 30 minutes.

**Important Observation about Candidate Performance:**

Many candidates claim extensive **Excel** use during interviews. However, a significant portion of them perform poorly on practical **Excel** tests.  **Therefore, practice is crucial before interviews.**

**Office 2021 Launch and Key New Features: A Detailed Overview**

**(Video URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi10BjP9qlk)**

**Introduction to Office 2021**

So, Microsoft has just launched **Office 2021**.  This release marks a significant step up from **Office 2019**, particularly for Excel users. If you are currently using **Office 2016** or **2019** and your IT department is hesitant to upgrade to **Microsoft 365**,  hoping for an upgrade to **Office 2021** is a reasonable expectation.

Beyond **Excel**, this overview will also highlight key improvements in **PowerPoint**, **Word**, and **Outlook**.

Let's quickly examine the benefits you'll gain by upgrading, whether you're coming from **Office 2016** or **2019**.

**Excel Enhancements: New Functions in Office 2021**

**Upgrade Context:**

*   **Excel 2019** introduced **six** new functions.
*   Users upgrading from **Office 2016** to **2021** will gain access to these functions in addition to the new **Excel 2021** features.
*   **Excel 2021** boasts **nine** new functions designed to transform your Excel workflow.

We'll now explore each of these new functions to understand their functionality and impact.  Detailed videos are available separately for most of these functions for in-depth learning.

**Benefits of New Functions:**

*   **Reduced Formula Complexity:**  Spend less time combining complex formulas to achieve your desired results.
*   **Simplified Formulas:** Formulas that were lengthy in **Excel 2019** are now significantly shorter and more straightforward in **Excel 2021**.
    *   Example:  A complex formula in Excel 2019 is now streamlined in Excel 2021. *(Note: The specific formula example was verbally mentioned and not visually presented in the transcript, so it's noted conceptually)*

If any of these functions resonate with you and seem useful for your work, please leave a comment below!

**New Excel 2021 Functions Explained:**

**1. UNIQUE Function**

*   **Purpose:** Extracts a list of distinct values from a range. Creates a unique list.
*   **Example:**  To get a unique list of departments:
    *   Type `=UNIQUE(range)`
    *   Select the range of department values.
    *   Press Enter.
    *   Result: A list of unique department names.
*   **Old Method (Complexity):**  The previous method involved writing a more complex formula and dragging it down to apply to the entire range.
    *   Example of old complex formula mentioned but not fully shown in transcript.
*   **Dynamic Array Functionality:**  Like other new functions, `UNIQUE` is a dynamic array function.
    *   No need to drag the formula down; it "spills" the results automatically.
*   **#SPILL Error:** Be aware of the `#SPILL` error.
    *   Occurs if something is blocking the spilled range.
    *   Example: Text in cells below the formula will cause a `#SPILL` error.
    *   Solution: Remove the blockage to allow the formula to spill correctly.

**2. FILTER Function**

*   **Purpose:** Returns all matching results from a range based on specified criteria, not just the first match.
*   **Example:** To get a list of staff in a selected department:
    *   Type `=FILTER(array, include, [if_empty])`
    *   **Array:** The range of values to return (e.g., staff names).
    *   **Include:**  The criteria to filter by (similar to an "IF" logical test).
        *   Example: `department_range = selected_department_cell`
    *   **[if_empty] (Optional):**  What to display if no matches are found (e.g., `""` for empty).
    *   Press Enter.
    *   Result: A list of staff names from the chosen department.
*   **Dynamic Range:** The output range automatically adjusts (shrinks or expands) as the filter results change.
*   **Old Method (Complexity):** Previous methods required complex formulas and often involved intermediate calculations.
    *   Example of old complex formula mentioned but not fully shown in transcript.

**3. SORT Function**

*   **Purpose:** Dynamically sorts a range of data.
*   **Example:** To get a sorted list of divisions:
    *   Type `=SORT(array, [sort_index], [sort_order], [by_col])`
    *   **Array:** The range to sort (can be a table range).
    *   **[sort_index] (Optional):** Column to sort by (default is 1st column).
    *   **[sort_order] (Optional):** Sort order (1 for ascending - default, -1 for descending).
    *   **[by_col] (Optional):** Sort by column (FALSE - default) or by row (TRUE).
    *   Press Enter for ascending sort (default).
    *   For descending sort: `=SORT(range, , -1)`
*   **Combining with UNIQUE:** To get a unique sorted list, nest the `SORT` function within the `UNIQUE` function: `=SORT(UNIQUE(range))`
*   **Table Integration:** Works seamlessly with Excel tables.
    *   If data is added to a table used in the `SORT` function, the sorted list automatically updates.

**4. SORTBY Function**

*   **Purpose:** Sorts one range based on the order of another related range.
*   **Example:** To get a list of staff names sorted by salary (highest to lowest):
    *   Type `=SORTBY(array, by_array1, [sort_order1], ...)`
    *   **Array:** The range to return (e.g., staff names).
    *   **by_array1:** The range to sort by (e.g., salary range).
    *   **[sort_order1] (Optional):** Sort order for `by_array1` (1 for ascending - default, -1 for descending).
    *   Press Enter for descending salary sort: `=SORTBY(names_range, salary_range, -1)`
    *   Result: Staff names listed in order of salary from highest to lowest.

**5. XLOOKUP Function**

*   **Purpose:** A more powerful and easier-to-use alternative to `VLOOKUP` and `HLOOKUP`.
*   **Advantages over VLOOKUP:**
    *   Can look to the left and right of the lookup column.
    *   Column order in the data doesn't matter.
    *   Simpler syntax, even with optional arguments.
*   **Example:** To find salary and department based on name:
    *   Type `=XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode])`
    *   **lookup_value:** The value to search for (e.g., name).
    *   **lookup_array:** The range to search in (e.g., name column).
    *   **return_array:** The range to return values from (e.g., salary column or department column).
    *   **[if_not_found] (Optional):** Value to return if no match is found (e.g., `"Check Name"`).
    *   **[match_mode] (Optional):** Match type (0 for exact match - default).
    *   **[search_mode] (Optional):** Search direction.
    *   Example for Salary: `=XLOOKUP(name_cell, name_range, salary_range)`
    *   Example for Department (department column is before name column): `=XLOOKUP(name_cell, name_range, department_range)`
*   **Handling Missing Data:** Use the `[if_not_found]` argument to specify a value to return if the lookup value is not found, preventing errors.
*   **Old Method (Complexity):**  Previous methods, especially for looking to the left, often involved `INDEX` and `MATCH` combinations, which were more complex and harder to understand.  Also often required `IFERROR` to handle missing values.

**6. XMATCH Function**

*   **Purpose:** Returns the relative position of an item in a list. Replaces the older `MATCH` function with a simplified syntax.
*   **Advantage over MATCH:** Fewer arguments to manage.
*   **Example:** To check if staff names are in a registered sports list:
    *   Type `=XMATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_mode], [search_mode])`
    *   **lookup_value:** The value to search for (e.g., staff name).
    *   **lookup_array:** The list to search within (e.g., sports registration list).
    *   **[match_mode] (Optional):** Match type (0 for exact match - default).
    *   **[search_mode] (Optional):** Search direction.
    *   Press Enter for exact match check: `=XMATCH(name_cell, sports_list_range)`
    *   Result: Returns the position of the name in the list or `#N/A` if not found.
*   **Default Exact Match:**  Defaults to exact match, simplifying the formula as you don't need to specify `0` like in the old `MATCH` function.
*   **Field Ranges:** Can easily use field ranges (e.g., table columns) for the `lookup_array`.
*   **Conditional Output:** Can be combined with `IF` to return alternate results instead of position numbers or `#N/A` (e.g., "On List" or "Not on List").

**7. SEQUENCE Function**

*   **Purpose:** Generates a list of numbers in a sequence, or dates in a sequence.
*   **Example 1: Number Sequence:**
    *   Type `=SEQUENCE(rows, [columns], [start], [step])`
    *   **rows:** Number of rows in the sequence.
    *   **[columns] (Optional):** Number of columns (default is 1).
    *   **[start] (Optional):** Starting number (default is 1).
    *   **[step] (Optional):** Increment between numbers (default is 1).
    *   Example for numbers 1 to 10 in a column: `=SEQUENCE(10)`
*   **Example 2: Date Sequence:**
    *   To generate dates from a start date to an end date:
        *   Calculate the number of days: `end_date - start_date`
        *   Use this as the `rows` argument in `SEQUENCE`.
        *   Set `start` to the start date.
        *   Set `step` to `1` for daily sequence or `7` for weekly sequence, etc.
        *   Example for daily dates: `=SEQUENCE(end_date_cell - start_date_cell + 1, , start_date_cell)` *(Note: +1 added to include end date)*
        *   Format the output column as "Short Date" to display dates correctly.

**8. RANDARRAY Function**

*   **Purpose:** Generates an array of random numbers in one go.
*   **Example:** To generate random grades for multiple students across subjects:
    *   Type `=RANDARRAY([rows], [columns], [min], [max], [integer])`
    *   **[rows] (Optional):** Number of rows of random numbers.
    *   **[columns] (Optional):** Number of columns of random numbers.
    *   **[min] (Optional):** Minimum random value (default is 0).
    *   **[max] (Optional):** Maximum random value (default is 1).
    *   **[integer] (Optional):** `TRUE` for integer values, `FALSE` or omitted for decimal values.
    *   Example for 4 rows x 6 columns of random decimals between 0 and 1: `=RANDARRAY(4, 6)`
    *   Example for 4 rows x 6 columns of random integers between 1 and 5: `=RANDARRAY(4, 6, 1, 5, TRUE)`
*   **Dynamic Refresh:** Random numbers regenerate every time the worksheet is refreshed (e.g., by pressing F9).

**9. LET Function**

*   **Purpose:**  Allows you to assign names to parts of a formula, improving readability and performance, especially for long or complex formulas with repetitions.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Readability:** Makes complex formulas easier to understand by breaking them down into named parts.
    *   **Performance:** Optimizes performance by calculating repeated parts of a formula only once and storing the result in memory for reuse.
*   **Syntax:**
    *   `=LET(name1, value1, name2, value2, ..., calculation)`
    *   Define names and their corresponding values before the final calculation.
*   **Example:**  Simplifying a formula with a repeated calculation (e.g., threshold calculation):
    *   Original Formula (with repetition): `IF(..., calculation, ..., calculation, ...)`
    *   Formula using LET: `=LET(threshold, calculation, IF(..., threshold, ..., threshold, ...))`
        *   `threshold` is defined as `calculation` once, and then `threshold` is used throughout the rest of the formula.

**Collaboration and Feature Enhancements in Office 2021**

**Excel Collaboration Features:**

*   **Sheet View:**  Found under the **"View"** tab.
    *   **Problem Solved:** In older Excel versions, filtering or sorting a shared sheet would affect all users simultaneously.

### **Introduction to the Quick Access Toolbar (QAT)**

Video URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Wkagedga1U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Wkagedga1U)

This video explores the **Quick Access Toolbar (QAT)** in Excel, emphasizing its purpose in enhancing productivity and ease of use. The speaker notes that while the Excel ribbon is extensive and can be overwhelming ("*the Excel ribbon is a jungle*"), the QAT serves as a customizable space for frequently used commands.

The core idea behind the QAT is to:

*   **Improve productivity:** By placing essential tools in an easily accessible location.
*   **Simplify navigation:** Making frequently used features readily available, regardless of the active ribbon tab.

The speaker mentions that they will be sharing their personal QAT setup, which might be surprising, even "shocking," to advanced Excel users. They acknowledge that their choices are personal and might not be conventional, having never shared them in previous videos.

**Audience Engagement:** The speaker encourages viewers to share their own QAT setups in the comments, asking specifically about:

*   The first item on their QAT.
*   A favorite item they have added to their QAT.

---

### **Exploring the Speaker's Quick Access Toolbar**

The speaker proceeds to demonstrate their QAT, highlighting its appearance and customization options:

*   **Visual Appearance:** The speaker points out the "new look of Office 365" with more color in the icons on the toolbar.
*   **Command Labels:** A new feature allows displaying command labels on the QAT. While this can be helpful, especially with fewer items, the speaker prefers the "condensed version" without labels for their extensive QAT setup.
*   **Hiding the QAT:** A newly introduced option is the ability to hide the QAT entirely.
    *   To **hide** the QAT, the option is available in the customization menu.
    *   To **show** the QAT again, right-click on the ribbon and select "Show Quick Access Toolbar."
*   **Location of QAT:**  The QAT can be positioned either above or below the ribbon. The default setting is now below the ribbon, although showing it above the ribbon remains an option.

---

### **Purpose and Benefits of Using the QAT**

The speaker reiterates the fundamental purpose of the QAT: to streamline the Excel user experience.

*   **Addressing Ribbon Complexity:** Excel's ribbon system, while comprehensive, can be complex to navigate. Users often need to remember the tab and location of specific features.
*   **Shortcut Keys vs. QAT:** While shortcut keys exist, the QAT offers an alternative, potentially more intuitive way to access frequently used commands, especially for users who may not remember or prefer shortcut keys.
*   **Customization Example - Gridlines:** The speaker illustrates adding a feature to the QAT using the "Gridlines" command as an example.
    *   To add "Gridlines" to QAT: Right-click on the "Gridlines" feature and select "Add to Quick Access Toolbar."
    *   This allows toggling gridlines on or off from any tab.
    *   To **remove** an item from the QAT: Right-click on the item and select "Remove from Quick Access Toolbar."

---

### **Accessing QAT Items with Shortcut Keys**

The QAT items can also be activated using shortcut keys:

*   **Using the ALT Key:** Pressing the ALT key reveals numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) associated with each item on the QAT.
*   **Activating Commands:** Pressing the corresponding number activates the respective QAT command.
    *   Example: Pressing ALT then '3' activates the email attachment option in the speaker's QAT, attaching the current Excel workbook to a new Outlook email message.

---

### **Detailed Breakdown of the Speaker's QAT Items**

The speaker now provides a detailed walkthrough of each item on their personal QAT, explaining the rationale behind each choice:

#### **1. Print Preview Full Screen**

*   **Distinction from Standard Print Preview:** This is the "old legacy way" of Print Preview, different from the newer "Print Preview and Print" option found in the ribbon.
*   **Newer Print Preview ("Print Preview and Print"):** Accessing this option leads to a screen with settings dropdowns and a print button. The speaker expresses dissatisfaction with this newer interface.
*   **Legacy Print Preview ("Print Preview Full Screen"):** This QAT item opens the classic Print Preview interface, which the speaker prefers for its ease of use and comprehensive settings management.
    *   Features of Legacy Print Preview:  Easier settings adjustments, access to "Page Setup" for detailed options, and separate buttons for "Print" and "Close Print Preview."

#### **2. Spelling**

*   **Shortcut Key Alternative:**  The standard shortcut key for spelling is F7.
*   **Purpose on QAT:** For the speaker, the Spelling item on the QAT serves as a visual reminder to check spelling before printing or emailing a workbook.
*   **Location on Ribbon:** The Spelling feature is also available directly on the ribbon.

#### **3. Separator**

*   **Visual Organization:** Separators are used to visually group and organize items on the QAT, improving clarity and navigation.
*   **Customization:** Separators can be added and positioned as needed within the QAT.

#### **4. - 6. Power Query and Data Model Features**

*   **Power Query - Get Data from Table/Range:** Used to quickly send data from an Excel range or table to Power Query.
    *   Action: Converts the selected range to an Excel table (if it isn't already) and opens Power Query Editor with the table as the data source.
*   **Power Query - Get Data from Various Sources:** Provides quick access to import data from different sources like workbooks, text files, etc.
*   **Data Model - Power Pivot Window & Add Measure:** Opens the Power Pivot window and facilitates adding measures in Power Pivot.
    *   Ribbon Location: These Power Pivot functionalities are also available within the Excel ribbon.
    *   Reason for QAT Inclusion: Frequent use of Power Query and Data Model features led to their addition to the QAT for faster access.

#### **7. Separator**

*   Another separator for visual organization.

#### **8. - 10. Pasting Options**

*   **Paste Values & Source Formatting:** Pastes copied content while preserving both values and original formatting.
*   **Paste Values Only:** Pastes only the values, discarding any formatting from the copied content.
*   **Paste Values and Source Formatting (again - possibly a slight redundancy in description, or intended as separate but similar actions):**  Reiterates the first paste option.
*   **Shortcut Key Alternatives:** While shortcut keys exist for pasting values, the QAT options are preferred for ease of use in certain situations.

#### **11. Dollar Sign ($)**

*   **Purpose:**  To insert dollar signs ($) for absolute cell referencing in formulas.
*   **F4 Key Functionality:** The F4 key is the standard way to toggle through relative, absolute, and mixed cell references by inserting dollar signs.
*   **Slim Keyboard Issue:** On compact keyboards, accessing F4 often requires pressing a Function (Fn) key simultaneously, making it less convenient, especially when multitasking (e.g., holding a coffee cup).
*   **QAT Dollar Sign Solution:** The QAT dollar sign icon provides a one-click way to insert dollar signs, freeing up a hand.
*   **Limitation:** Unlike the F4 key, the QAT dollar sign inserts a single dollar sign and doesn't toggle through reference types. It requires manually placing dollar signs before both the column and row references for full absolute referencing (e.g., `$A$1`).
*   **Feature Request:** The speaker expresses a wish for a dedicated "F4 feature" button on the ribbon or QAT, particularly beneficial for users with slim keyboards and touchscreens, suggesting it would improve user experience across different devices.

#### **12. Collapse/Show Ribbon**

*   **Purpose:** To toggle the Excel ribbon between collapsed (hidden) and expanded (visible) states.
*   **Shortcut Key Alternative:**  Ctrl + F1 is the standard shortcut for collapsing/showing the ribbon.
*   **Slim Keyboard Issue (Again):**  Similar to the F4 key, using Ctrl + F1 on slim keyboards often requires pressing Ctrl + Function (Fn) + F1, considered cumbersome.
*   **QAT Button Convenience:**  The QAT button provides a simpler, one-click method for ribbon control.

#### **13. Camera Tool**

*   **Uncommon Feature:** The speaker mentions using the Camera tool less frequently, primarily for creating specialized dashboards.
*   **Functionality:** The Camera tool creates a "linked picture" of selected cells or ranges.
    *   Linked Picture Behavior: The created picture is dynamic; changes in the source cells are reflected in the picture.
    *   Object Properties: The camera output is a separate object that can be resized and repositioned independently, useful for dashboard layouts.
*   **Ribbon Inaccessibility:** The Camera tool is not directly available on the Excel ribbon by default and needs to be added through customization.

#### **14. Calculator**

*   **Rationale:** Despite Excel being a calculation tool itself, a separate calculator on the QAT serves a specific purpose.
*   **Avoiding Data Pollution:**  The speaker describes a common scenario where they might perform quick calculations directly within a working Excel file when asked for figures by colleagues. This can lead to accidentally leaving temporary numbers in cells.
*   **QAT Calculator as a Solution:**  Using the QAT Calculator prevents accidental data entry in the active workbook.
*   **Alternative - New Workbook:** If more extensive calculation within Excel is needed, the speaker uses Ctrl + N to quickly open a new, blank workbook, keeping calculations separate from the main working file.

---

### **Call for Audience Participation and Customization Guidance**

The speaker concludes this section by:

*   **Reiterating Audience Engagement:**  Expressing interest in viewers' QAT setups and encouraging them to share their own configurations and "cool" items in the comments.

---

### **Customizing Your Quick Access Toolbar: "More Commands"**

The speaker then provides instructions on how to customize the QAT and find less obvious commands like "Print Preview Full Screen" and "Camera Tool":

*   **Accessing Customization Options:** Click the dropdown arrow at the end of the QAT and select "More Commands."
*   **"Excel Options" Window:** This opens the "Excel Options" window, specifically to the "Quick Access Toolbar" section.
*   **"Choose commands from" Dropdown:** This dropdown menu allows filtering commands from different sources.
    *   **"Popular Commands" (Default):** Initially displays commonly used commands.
    *   **"Commands Not in the Ribbon":**  Crucial for finding tools like "Camera Tool" and "Print Preview Full Screen" which are not readily available on the standard ribbon tabs.
    *   **"All Commands":** Lists every available command in Excel, providing the most comprehensive but also potentially overwhelming list.
*   **Alphabetical Sorting:** Commands are listed alphabetically based on their English names.
*   **Finding "Print Preview Full Screen":**
    *   Change "Choose commands from" to "All Commands" or "Commands Not in the Ribbon."
    *   Scroll down to "P" (for Print) to locate "Print Preview Full Screen."
    *   Select the item and click "Add" to move it to the QAT customization list on the right.
*   **Organizing QAT Items:** Once added, items can be rearranged using the "Up" and "Down" arrow buttons in the "Excel Options" window.
*   **Finding Paste Options:**  Highlights the non-intuitive naming and categorization of some commands.
    *   Paste options are **not** found under "P" for "Paste."
    *   Paste value options are located under **"V" for "Values"**: Look for "Paste Values," "Paste Values and Source Formatting."
    *   Some paste options are also found under **"K" for "Keep"**:  e.g., "Keep Source Column Widths," "Keep Source Formatting."
    *   **Tip:**  Finding specific commands may require patience and exploration due to less-than-obvious naming conventions and locations within the command lists.

---

### **Customization by Ribbon Tabs and Adding Separators & Macros**

*   **Customizing from Ribbon Tabs:** The "Choose commands from" dropdown also allows selecting specific ribbon tabs (e.g., "Home Tab").
    *   This filters the command list to only show items available within the chosen tab, making it easier to find commands related to a specific area of Excel functionality.
    *   **Context-Sensitive Tabs:**  Contextual tabs like "PivotTable Tools" or "Table Tools" (which appear when a pivot table or table is selected) are also available in the dropdown, allowing users to add relevant commands from these specialized tabs to the QAT.
*   **Adding Separators:**
    *   The "Separator" option is available at the top of the command list in the "Excel Options" window.
    *   Select "Separator" and click "Add" to insert a separator into the QAT item list.
    *   Separators can be moved and positioned like other QAT items to create visual groupings.
*   **Adding Macros:**
    *   If you have VBA macros that are globally accessible, they will appear in the command list under "Macros" (in the "Choose commands from" dropdown).
    *   Macros can be added to the QAT just like any other command, providing quick access to custom VBA procedures.

---

### **Concluding Remarks and Call to Action**

The speaker summarizes the benefits of QAT customization:

*   **Ease of Customization:**  Emphasizes how straightforward it is to personalize the QAT.
*   **Access to Hidden Features:**  QAT allows adding commands that are not readily found on the ribbon.
*   **Checklist Functionality:**  Suggests using the QAT as a visual checklist for remembering to perform specific actions on datasets.

**Final Call to Action:**

*   Encourages viewers to "hit that thumbs up" if they enjoyed the video.
*   Thanks viewers for watching and being present.
*   Announces "See you in the next video."

**Video Tutorial: Combining Data from Multiple Cells in Excel**

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxdp5Z2I0mg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxdp5Z2I0mg)

**Introduction**

In this tutorial, you will learn how to combine data from multiple cells in Excel effectively.  We'll cover techniques for merging values from different cells in a meaningful way.  As a bonus, you'll discover a clever trick to use text and number combinations in formulas, even when Excel might initially ignore the text part. This allows you to use these combinations in functions like **SUM** for calculations. Sounds interesting? Let's dive in!

---

**Section 1: Basic Cell Combination Using Ampersand (&)**

Let's start with a simple scenario where we want to combine the "Name" and "Amount" columns dynamically. This means if the values in the original cells change, the combined result will automatically update.

**Steps to Combine Cell Values:**

1.  **Start with the Equal Sign (=):** Begin by typing an equal sign in the cell where you want the combined result to appear. This signals the start of a formula.
2.  **Select the First Cell (A2):**  Click on the first cell you want to include in the combination (e.g., cell **A2** containing "Bill"). This will add the cell reference to your formula.
3.  **Use the Ampersand (&) Operator:**  Type an ampersand (&) symbol. This operator is used to concatenate (join together) values in Excel.
4.  **Select the Second Cell:** Click on the next cell you want to combine (e.g., cell next to "Amount," containing "1000").
5.  **Complete the Formula:** Press **Enter**.

    *   **Example Formula:** `=A2&B2`

    *   **Initial Result:** "Bill1000" (Values are combined directly without spacing)

**Combining Multiple Cells:**

*   You are not limited to just two cells. You can combine values from any number of cells.
*   Simply continue adding ampersands and selecting the next cell you want to include in the combination.

    *   **Example for three cells:** `=A2&B2&C2`

---

**Section 2: Adding Spaces and Text to Combined Values**

The initial result "Bill1000" isn't very readable. Let's improve it by adding a space between the name and the amount.

**Adding a Space:**

1.  **Edit the Formula:** Go back to the formula you created in the previous step and edit it.
2.  **Insert Quotation Marks for Text:**  Right after the first ampersand, add quotation marks `""`. Quotation marks are used to enclose text strings in Excel formulas.
3.  **Add a Space within Quotation Marks:** Inside the quotation marks, type a space: `" "`.
4.  **Add Another Ampersand:** After the closing quotation mark, add another ampersand `&`. This is crucial to connect the text (space) with the next cell reference.

    *   **Corrected Formula (with space):** `=A2&" "&B2`

    *   **Result:** "Bill 1000" (Now with a space in between)

**Important Note: Ampersand for Text Combination**

*   You **cannot** directly combine text with a cell reference without the ampersand operator.
*   Excel requires the ampersand to join text strings (including spaces within quotation marks) with cell references.
*   Without the ampersand, you will get an error.

**Adding Other Text (e.g., Dash, Dollar Sign):**

*   You can add any text you want within the quotation marks.
*   For example, to add a space, dash, space:  `" - "`
*   To add a dollar sign before the number: `" $" `

    *   **Example with space, dash, space:** `=A2&" - "&B2`  (Result: "Bill - 1000")
    *   **Example with dollar sign and space:** `=A2&" $ "&B2` (Result: "Bill $ 1000")

**Dynamic Updates:**

*   These formulas are dynamic. If you change the value in any of the original cells (e.g., update "Bill" to "William"), the combined result will automatically update.

**Applying the Formula to Multiple Rows:**

*   Use the fill handle (the small square at the bottom right of the selected cell) to drag the formula down to apply it to other rows.
*   Alternatively, double-click the fill handle to automatically fill the formula down to the last adjacent cell with data.

**Section 3: Formatting Numbers with the TEXT Function**

What if you want to format numbers within the combined text, for instance, to display thousands separators? This is where the **TEXT** function becomes useful.

**Using the TEXT Function for Number Formatting:**

1.  **Recall the Goal:** We want to display numbers with proper formatting, like thousands separators (e.g., "1,000" instead of "1000").
2.  **Introduce the TEXT Function:** The **TEXT** function converts a value into text in a specific format that you define.

    *   **Syntax:** `=TEXT(value, format_text)`
        *   **value:** The number you want to format.
        *   **format_text:**  A text string specifying the desired format.

**Finding the Correct Format Code:**

It can be tricky to remember the format codes. Here's an easy way to find them:

1.  **Format Cells Dialog:** Right-click on any cell containing a number and select "Format Cells..." (or use the shortcut **Ctrl + 1**).
2.  **Go to "Custom" Category:** In the "Format Cells" dialog box, navigate to the "Number" tab and select the "Custom" category.
3.  **Choose a Predefined Format:**  Select a predefined format that is close to what you need (e.g., one with thousands separators).
4.  **Copy the Format Code:** The "Type" box will show the format code. Select and copy this code (**Ctrl + C**).
5.  **Click "Cancel":**  Click "Cancel" to close the "Format Cells" dialog without applying any changes to the cell you right-clicked on. We only needed to copy the format code.

**Applying the Format Code in the TEXT Function:**

1.  **Edit the Combination Formula:** Go back to your cell combination formula.
2.  **Embed the TEXT Function:**  Wrap the cell reference that contains the number (e.g., **B2**) within the **TEXT** function.
3.  **Paste the Format Code:**  In the `format_text` argument of the **TEXT** function, paste the format code you copied from the "Format Cells" dialog. Make sure to enclose the format code in quotation marks.

    *   **Example Formula (with thousands separator):** `=A2&" $ "&TEXT(B2, "#,##0")`

        *   `"#,##0"` is the format code for numbers with thousands separators (comma as separator, zero for no decimal places).  The hash `#` and zero `0` are placeholders for digits.

    *   **Result:** "Bill $ 1,000" (Number now formatted with thousands separator)

**Understanding Format Codes (Briefly):**

*   `#` and `0` are placeholders for numbers in format codes.
*   `,` in the format code represents the thousands separator (based on your regional settings – comma in US settings, dot in some other locales).
*   `.` in the format code represents the decimal separator (dot in US settings, comma in some other locales).

**Section 4: Bonus Tip - Text Disguised as Numbers for Calculations**

This bonus tip shows you how to display text alongside numbers while still allowing Excel to recognize and calculate the underlying numerical values.

**Scenario:**

*   You have "Amount Base" and "Bonus" columns, and you want to display totals with labels like "Base Total" and "Bonus Total".
*   You want to sum the "Amount Base" and "Bonus" columns separately and also sum them together.

**Problem:**

*   If you directly combine text with numbers using formulas like we did before, Excel treats the result as text, not as a number. This prevents you from directly summing these combined values.

**Solution: Custom Formatting to Disguise Numbers as Text**

Instead of using the **TEXT** function in the summation cells themselves, we will use custom cell formatting.

**Steps:**

1.  **Calculate Sums First:** Use the **SUM** function to calculate the totals for "Amount Base" and "Bonus" in separate cells. Also calculate the overall sum of both columns in another cell.
2.  **Select the Sum Cell:** Select the cell containing the sum you want to format (e.g., the "Base Total" sum).
3.  **Open "Format Cells" Dialog:** Press **Ctrl + 1** to open the "Format Cells" dialog.
4.  **Go to "Custom" Category:** Navigate to the "Number" tab and select "Custom".
5.  **Reuse Existing Number Format (Optional):** If you want to keep the thousands separator formatting, find and select a format with thousands separators from the list (or re-enter `#,##0`).
6.  **Add Text to the Format Code:** In the "Type" box, at the beginning of the format code, inside quotation marks, type the text you want to display followed by a space and then close the quotation marks.

    *   **Example Format Code for "Base Total":** `"Base: " #,##0`  (Note the space after "Base: ")
    *   **Example Format Code for "Bonus Total":** `"Bonus: " #,##0`

7.  **Click "OK":** Click "OK" to apply the custom format.

**Explanation:**

*   By adding the text "Base: " (or "Bonus: ") within the custom format, you are instructing Excel to display this text prefix before the number in the cell.
*   However, **the underlying value in the cell remains a number.** Excel only changes how it *displays* the number.
*   Because the underlying value is still a number, you can still use these cells in calculations (like summing them together).

**Benefits:**

*   Numbers are displayed with descriptive text labels.
*   The cells still contain numerical values, allowing them to be used in calculations (e.g., SUM function).
*   No need for complex formulas to combine text and numbers for display purposes in summary cells.

**Conclusion**

You've now learned several methods to combine text and numbers in Excel:

*   **Basic Combination:** Using the ampersand (&) to join cell values.
*   **Adding Text and Spaces:** Inserting text strings within quotation marks and using ampersands.
*   **Number Formatting with TEXT Function:** Using the **TEXT** function for precise number formatting within combined text.
*   **Bonus Trick: Custom Formatting for Disguised Text:**  Using custom cell formatting to display text labels while keeping the underlying values as numbers for calculations.

These techniques provide flexible ways to present and manipulate data in Excel. Experiment with these methods to enhance your spreadsheets.

**Video Introduction**

Video URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnCvn6CmP2k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnCvn6CmP2k)

If you're watching this, it's likely you're a daily **Excel** user with established routines. Over time, these routines become so ingrained that you might not even realize you're not using Excel as efficiently as you could be. Let's change that! I've compiled a list of common mistakes many of us consistently make in **Excel**, and I'll show you the better way to do things. Let's dive in!

**Common Excel Mistakes and How to Fix Them**

### **1. Unintentional External Links**

One frequent error is creating **external links** to other files without realizing it.

*   **Identifying Unintentional Links:**
    *   Go to the **Data** tab in Excel.
    *   Check if **Edit Links** is active (not grayed out).
    *   Click **Edit Links** to see if there are links you don't recognize or need.

*   **Origin of Unintentional Links:**
    *   Often occurs when copying worksheets from different files into a new file.
    *   Links from the original files can be carried over, unintentionally referencing the old sources.
    *   This was a common issue at my previous company due to frequent worksheet copying.

*   **Correct Way to Copy Worksheets and Manage Links:**
    *   **Scenario:** Copying a sheet with formulas referencing another sheet within the *same* file, but wanting the formulas to reference a sheet in the *destination* file.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Start File:** Contains "Calculation Sheet" (formulas referencing "Master Sheet") and "Master Sheet".
        *   **LocalFile:**  Also contains a "Master Sheet".
        *   **Goal:** Copy "Calculation Sheet" from "Start File" to "LocalFile" and have formulas reference the "Master Sheet" in "LocalFile".

    *   **Steps for Correct Copying:**
        1.  In the **Start File**, right-click on the "Calculation Sheet" tab.
        2.  Select **Move or Copy**.
        3.  Check the **Create a copy** box (if you want to keep the original sheet).
        4.  Choose **LocalFile** as the destination file.
        5.  Click **OK**.

    *   **Problem:** After copying, formulas in the "Calculation Sheet" in "LocalFile" *still* reference the **Start File**, not "LocalFile". You'll see the old file name in the formula bar.

    *   **Solution: Edit Links to Change Source:**
        1.  Go to **Data** tab.
        2.  Click **Edit Links**.
        3.  Select **Change Source**.
        4.  Choose **LocalFile** (the file you copied *to*) as the new source. This makes the formulas reference the "Master Sheet" within "LocalFile" itself.
        5.  After changing the source, **Edit Links** should become grayed out, indicating no external links.

    *   **Removing Links Completely (Breaking Links):**
        *   If you want to remove formulas and just keep values, use the **Break Link** option in the **Edit Links** dialog box.

---

### **2. Manually Breaking Text into Multiple Cells (Instead of Using "Justify")**

This is about productivity and avoiding tedious manual work.

*   **The Wrong Way (Manual Text Breaking):**
    *   When text in a cell becomes too long, manually cutting and pasting portions of the text into adjacent cells to create the appearance of wrapping.
    *   Example: Cutting text after "two here" and pasting it in the next cell, then repeating for further breaks.
    *   **Problem:** Very inefficient, especially if you need to adjust text later, requiring you to redo the manual cutting and pasting.

*   **The Right Way: Using "Fill" and "Justify"**
    1.  **Select the Range:** Decide where you want the text to wrap and select a horizontal range of cells wide enough to accommodate the text after wrapping. The starting cell should contain the long text.
    2.  Go to the **Home** tab.
    3.  In the **Editing** group (far right), click **Fill**.
    4.  Select **Justify**.
    5.  **Result:** Excel automatically breaks the text and distributes it within the selected range.

*   **Reversing "Justify" (Putting Text Back into One Cell):**
    1.  **Widen the First Cell:** Make the first cell wide enough to hold all the text on a single line.
    2.  **Select the Range:** Select the range of cells containing the justified text, ensuring the first cell is included.
    3.  Go to **Home** -> **Fill** -> **Justify**.
    4.  **Result:** The text is combined back into the first cell.

---

### **3. Merging Cells in Data Ranges (Instead of "Center Across Selection")**

While merging cells has its place (like for report titles), it's problematic within datasets.

*   **The Problem with Merging Cells in Data:**
    *   **Example:** Merging cells for year headings (e.g., "2019," "2020," "2021") above columns of data.
    *   **Issue:** Merged cells disrupt cell range selection for formulas.
    *   When you try to select a column under merged cells for a function (like **SUM**), the merged cell expands the selected range unexpectedly.
    *   Requires manual adjustments to ranges or using techniques like holding **Ctrl** to select non-contiguous ranges, which is cumbersome, especially in large datasets.

*   **The Better Solution: "Center Across Selection"**
    1.  **Unmerge Cells:** If cells are already merged, unmerge them to revert to individual cells.
    2.  **Select the Range:** Select the cells you *would* have merged to center the heading over the columns.
    3.  **Format Cells:**
        *   Right-click on the selection and choose **Format Cells**, or use the shortcut **Ctrl + 1**.
        *   Go to the **Alignment** tab.
        4.  **Choose "Center Across Selection":** In the **Horizontal** dropdown, select **Center Across Selection**.
        5.  Click **OK**.

    *   **Result:** Visually, it looks like the cells are merged (text is centered across), but they remain *separate* cells. This allows for normal range selections in formulas without issues.

*   **Benefits of "Center Across Selection":**
    *   Maintains cell integrity for formulas and data manipulation.
    *   Provides the visual centering effect of merged cells without the functional drawbacks.

*   **Tips for Working with "Center Across Selection":**
    *   **Quick Access Toolbar:** Add alignment settings to your Quick Access Toolbar for faster access. You can find the option under **Format Cells** options in the Excel Options menu.
    *   **Finding Merged Cells:**
        1.  Press **Ctrl + F** to open the **Find and Replace** dialog.
        2.  Click **Format**.
        3.  Go to the **Alignment** tab in the **Format Cells** dialog.
        4.  Check the **Merge cells** box.
        5.  Click **OK**.
        6.  Click **Find Next** or **Find All** to locate merged cells in your sheet or workbook.
        7.  You can then apply formatting changes like "Center Across Selection" to these cells.

---

### **4. Poor File Structure (Everything on One Sheet)**

Organizing your Excel file into logical sheets improves clarity and maintainability.

*   **The Problem: Cramming Everything onto a Single Sheet:**
    *   Source data, calculations, and charts/visualizations all on the same worksheet.
    *   Makes files cluttered, difficult to navigate, and harder to understand and maintain.

*   **The Solution: Separate Tabs for Different Purposes:**
    *   **Dashboard/Report Tab:** For final outputs, charts, and summaries.
    *   **Calculation Tab:**  For all intermediate calculations and formulas.
    *   **Source Data Tab:** For raw data input (if data is directly in Excel). If data comes from external sources (like Power Query), this might be less relevant, but consider a tab for transformed/cleaned data before calculations.
    *   **Instructions Tab:**  For file documentation, explaining the purpose, usage, and any important notes.
    *   **Change Log/Control Tab:** To track changes made to the file over time, version control notes, etc.

*   **Visual Organization with Tab Colors:**
    *   Use tab colors to visually group related tabs or to highlight important tabs.
    *   Makes navigation faster and more intuitive.

---

### **5. Hiding Rows and Columns Incorrectly (Instead of Grouping)**

Hiding rows and columns can be confusing and lead to errors if not done carefully. Grouping offers a more transparent alternative.

*   **The Problem with Hiding Rows:**
    *   **Example:** Receiving a file where some rows are hidden for chart data preparation.
    *   **Issue:** Hidden rows can be easily overlooked, leading to incorrect calculations if you're not aware of them.
    *   In the example, summing visible data gives an incorrect total because hidden rows contain additional values.
    *   **Subtle Visual Cue:** Excel provides a faint double line indicator where rows are hidden, but it's easy to miss, especially in large datasets.

*   **The Solution: Using Grouping Instead of Hiding**
    1.  **Select Rows/Columns to Group:** Select the rows or columns you want to temporarily "hide" or collapse.
    2.  **Group:**
        *   **Shortcut:** **Shift + Alt + Right Arrow Key**.
        *   **Menu:** Go to the **Data** tab, in the **Outline** group, click **Group**.
    3.  **Result:** Excel creates a grouping structure with a clear visual indicator (a line with a +/- control).
    4.  **Collapse/Expand:** Click the "-" button to collapse the group (effectively hiding the rows/columns) or the "+" button to expand it (show the rows/columns).

*   **Ungrouping:**
    *   **Shortcut:** **Shift + Alt + Left Arrow Key**.
    *   **Menu:** Go to the **Data** tab, in the **Outline** group, click **Ungroup**.

*   **Benefits of Grouping over Hiding:**
    *   **Clear Visual Indication:** Grouping clearly shows that sections of data are collapsed, making it less likely to be overlooked.
    *   **Improved Transparency:** Makes data structure more understandable for others (especially when sharing files).

*   **Best Practice:** In complex scenarios, it's still generally better to separate calculations into a separate tab rather than relying on hiding or grouping within the main data tab.

---

### **6. Hardcoding Values in Formulas (Instead of Using Cell References)**

Hardcoding values directly into formulas can create maintenance and error tracking nightmares, especially in complex models.

*   **The Problem: Hardcoded Values:**
    *   **Example:** In a financial model, a discount factor of 6% is directly typed into a formula instead of referencing a dedicated cell containing the discount rate.
    *   **Issues:**
        *   **Difficult to Track:** Hardcoded values are buried within formulas and hard to find and update consistently across the model.
        *   **Error Prone:** If the value needs to be changed, you have to manually find and edit every formula where it's hardcoded, increasing the risk of missing instances and introducing inconsistencies.
        *   **Reduced Flexibility:** Makes "what-if" analysis and scenario testing cumbersome.

*   **Identifying Hardcoded Values:**
    *   **Trace Dependents:** Select a cell that *should* be driving a formula, and use **Formulas** tab -> **Trace Dependents** to see which formulas are using that cell. If a formula is *not* dependent on the expected cell, it might have a hardcoded value.
    *   **Trace Precedents:** Select a cell with a formula and use **Formulas** tab -> **Trace Precedents** to see which cells are feeding into that formula. If a value within the formula is not traced back to a precedent cell, it's likely hardcoded.

*   **The Solution: Using Cell References**
    1.  **Create a Dedicated Cell for Input Values:**  Have a separate cell where you enter values that might change (like discount rates, assumptions, parameters).
    2.  **Reference the Cell in Formulas:** In your formulas, instead of typing the value directly, use a cell reference to the dedicated input cell.
    3.  **Absolute References ($):** Use absolute cell references (e.g., `$A$1`) if you need to drag the formula and want it to always refer to the *same* input cell.

*   **Example Correction:**
    *   Instead of `=... * 0.06 ...` (hardcoded 6%), have a cell (e.g., B1) with the value `8%` (or `0.08`).
    *   Then, use the formula `=... * $B$1 ...`.
    *   Now, to change the discount rate, you only need to update cell B1, and all formulas referencing it will automatically update.

*   **When Hardcoding Might Be Acceptable:**
    *   For truly constant values that *never* change, like the number of days in a week (7) or hours in a day (24). These are fundamental constants and unlikely to be adjusted in a model.

---

### **7. Not Utilizing Tables**

Excel Tables are powerful features that automate many tasks and improve data management.

*   **The Problem: Not Using Tables for Data Sets:**
    *   Working with raw data ranges instead of converting them to Excel Tables.
    *   Missed opportunities for automation and dynamic updates.

*   **Benefits of Using Excel Tables:**
    *   **Automatic Chart Updates:** Charts based on tables automatically expand to include new data added to the table.
    *   **Automatic Formula Updates:** Formulas referencing table columns automatically adjust when rows are added or removed.
    *   **Automatic Pivot Table Updates:** Pivot tables based on tables dynamically refresh to reflect changes in the table data.
    *   **Automatic Formatting:** Formatting (like banded rows, header styles) is automatically applied to new rows added to the table.
    *   **Structured References in Formulas:** Tables use structured references (e.g., `TableName[ColumnName]`) in formulas, making them more readable and understandable.

*   **Creating an Excel Table:**
    1.  **Select Data Range:** Select the data you want to convert to a table (including headers).
    2.  **Insert Table:**
        *   Go to the **Insert** tab and click **Table**.
        *   Or, use the shortcut **Ctrl + T**.
    3.  **Confirm Headers:** In the "Create Table" dialog, ensure "My table has headers" is checked if your data range includes headers.
    4.  Click **OK**.

*   **Customizing Table Formatting:**
    *   **Table Styles:**  In the **Table Design** tab (appears when a table is selected), you can choose from pre-defined table styles or create your own.
    *   **Clearing Predefined Style:** Select "None" in the table styles gallery to remove the default table style and apply your own custom formatting.

*   **Adding Data to Tables:**
    *   Simply type new data in the row directly below the last row of the table, or in the column to the right of the last column. The table will automatically expand to include the new data.

*   **Deleting Table Rows (Without Deleting Workbook Rows):**
    1.  **Select Table Rows:** Select the rows *within the table* that you want to delete.
    2.  **Delete Table Rows:** Right-click on the selected rows and choose **Delete** -> **Table Rows**.
    *   **Important:** This deletes rows *only* from the table, not from the entire worksheet. Content outside the table remains unaffected.

*   **Example: Dynamic Chart with Tables:**
    1.  Create a chart based on a table's data.
    2.  Add new data to the table (rows or columns).
    3.  **Result:** The chart automatically updates to include the new data points without needing to manually adjust chart ranges.

**Video Introduction: Common Excel Errors and How to Fix Them**

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFn0gE_y1U4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFn0gE_y1U4)

Hello everyone! In this video, we're going to explore **seven common Excel errors** that you'll likely encounter.  Plus, I'll also share a **bonus tip** for dealing with an error you're bound to see eventually.

Now, while one way to "fix" errors is to simply delete them, **please don't do that!**  We want formulas that are consistent and, most importantly, working correctly.  If you're seeing errors, it's crucial to understand why they're happening and fix them properly, so you don't just mask the problem.

Let's dive right in and take a look at these common Excel errors and their solutions.

---

**Error #1:  ##### (Hash Signs)**

*   **Description:** When you see a series of hash signs (#####) in a cell.
*   **Cause:** This error occurs when the **number in the cell is too wide to be displayed within the current column width**. Excel's way of telling you "Hey, this number is too big to fit!".
*   **Excel's Behavior:** Excel intentionally shows hash signs for numbers instead of truncating them because it wants to avoid the risk of you reporting incorrect numerical values due to data being cut off.
*   **Text vs. Numbers:**  It's interesting to note that Excel handles text differently. For text, it *will* simply cut it off if it's too long for the column, but it takes a more cautious approach with numbers.
*   **Solution:** The easiest fix! **Double-click the right edge of the column header** to automatically expand the column width to fit the largest number in that column.

---

**Error #2: #VALUE!**

*   **Description:** The **#VALUE!** error.
*   **Cause:** This error generally arises when you are using the **wrong data type** in a formula.  Excel expects specific types of data for certain operations.
*   **Example Scenario:** Imagine you have a formula subtracting "Previous Year Sales" from "Actual Sales".
    *   **Numbers Work:** If both cells contain numbers, the formula works perfectly. Empty cells are treated as zeros in this context, so you won't get an error with empty cells in subtraction.
    *   **Text Causes Error:** However, if one of the cells contains **text** (e.g., you typed "missing" instead of a number), you will get a **#VALUE!** error.  You can only perform mathematical operations like subtraction between numbers, not between numbers and text.
*   **Default Behavior:** In simple formulas, Excel cannot directly perform operations between numbers and text.
*   **Workaround using SUM function:** Some built-in Excel functions are designed to handle or ignore text.
    *   **Using SUM to Ignore Text:** If you wrap your formula within the **SUM** function, like `SUM(your_formula)`, the **SUM function is intelligent enough to ignore text values**.
    *   **Result:** By using **SUM**, you can avoid the **#VALUE!** error even if there's text in the referenced cells, as **SUM** will effectively treat text as zero in this calculation.

---

**Error #3: #SPILL!**

*   **Description:** The **#SPILL!** error.
*   **Context:** This is a **newer error** introduced in **Office 365 and Office 2021**.
*   **Cause:**  The **#SPILL!** error occurs when you use a function that is designed to "spill" its results into **multiple cells**, but something is **blocking** the spill range.
*   **Example using UNIQUE function:** Let's say you use the **UNIQUE** function to extract a list of unique values from a range.
    *   **Formula Example:** `=UNIQUE(your_range)`
    *   **Error Scenario:** If the cells where the **UNIQUE** function wants to spill its results are **blocked** by existing content (like text, data, or even emojis!), you will get a **#SPILL!** error.
    *   **Humorous Example:** In the video example, the word "Subscribe" and an emoji were blocking the spill range, causing the error. The emoji in the formula bar is described as looking "even funnier".
*   **Solution:** **Identify and remove any content that is blocking the spill range**. Once the path is clear, the formula will spill correctly, and the error will disappear.

---

**Error #4: #NAME?**

*   **Description:** The **#NAME?** error.
*   **Cause:** This error is typically caused by a **mistake in typing the function name**. Excel cannot recognize the function name you've entered.
*   **Example:** If you try to use a function called "ADD" (which doesn't exist in Excel), you'll get a **#NAME?** error.
*   **Correct Function:** The correct function for addition in Excel is **SUM**.
*   **Solution:** **Check the spelling of your function name and correct it**.  Ensure you are using a valid Excel function name.

---

**Error #5: #REF!**

*   **Description:** The **#REF!** error.
*   **Cause:** This error indicates an **invalid cell reference** in your formula.  Essentially, your formula is trying to refer to a cell or range that no longer exists or is not valid in the current context.
*   **Scenario 1: Deleting Referenced Columns/Rows:**
    *   If your formula refers to a specific column or row, and you then **delete that column or row**, you will get a **#REF!** error.  The reference is now broken because the thing it was referring to is gone.
*   **Scenario 2: Copying and Pasting with Relative References:**
    *   **Relative Referencing:** Excel's default cell referencing is relative. This means when you copy a formula, the cell references adjust based on the new location.
    *   **Example:** If a formula in column C refers to a cell in column A (two columns to the left), and you copy this formula to column E, it will now try to refer to a cell two columns to the left of column E, which is column C.
    *   **Error when Reference Becomes Invalid:** If you copy a formula that uses relative references to a location where the relative reference becomes invalid (e.g., refers to a column that no longer logically exists in that new context), you'll encounter a **#REF!** error.  In the video example, copying a formula that was referencing a "Sales" column two columns to the left to a location where there was no "Sales" column two columns to the left resulted in the error.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Undo Deletion (Ctrl + Z):** If you accidentally deleted a referenced column or row, immediately **undo** the deletion.
    *   **Review Relative References after Copying:** When copying formulas, especially across different areas of your sheet, **carefully consider if relative references are still valid** in the new location.  You might need to adjust the formula or use absolute references ($ sign) if you want to prevent references from changing during copy/paste.

---

**Error #6: #DIV/0!**

*   **Description:** The **#DIV/0!** error.
*   **Cause:** This error occurs when you attempt to **divide a number by zero**.  Mathematically, division by zero is undefined.
*   **Example: Percentage Change Calculation:**  Calculating percentage change from the previous year often involves division. Let's say the formula is: `(Actual Sales / Previous Year Sales) - 1`.
    *   **Error when Previous Year Sales is Zero or Empty:** If "Previous Year Sales" is **zero or empty**, you'll get a **#DIV/0!** error.
    *   **Empty Cells as Zero:**  Crucially, **Excel treats empty cells as zeros when used in formulas**. So, even if a cell *looks* empty, if it's used as the divisor, it can cause this error.
*   **Incorrect Fix: Manually Removing Formulas:**  It's tempting to just delete the formula from cells showing the error. **Don't do this!** This is a bad practice because:
    *   **Loss of Dynamism:** If you later get data for the "Previous Year Sales" in those empty cells, the calculation *won't* automatically update because you've removed the formula.
*   **Correct Fix: Error Handling within the Formula:** Implement error handling directly within your formula to manage potential division-by-zero scenarios.
    *   **Using IFERROR Function:** The **IFERROR** function is a generic error handling function.
        *   **Syntax:** `IFERROR(value, value_if_error)`
        *   `value`:  Your original formula that might produce an error.
        *   `value_if_error`: What you want to display or return if an error occurs.
    *   **Example using IFERROR for #DIV/0!:**  `=IFERROR((Actual Sales / Previous Year Sales) - 1, "")`
        *   In this example, if the division results in a **#DIV/0!** error, **IFERROR** will return an **empty string** `""` (effectively making the cell appear blank).
    *   **Dynamic and Error-Safe:** Using **IFERROR** ensures that your formula remains in place and dynamic. If the "Previous Year Sales" is later filled in, the calculation will automatically run, and the error will be handled gracefully until then.
    *   **Alternative: IF function for specific condition:** You could also use an **IF** function to check for the zero or empty cell condition *before* the division, but **IFERROR** is often a more concise and general solution for error handling.

**Error #7: #N/A**

*   **Description:** The **#N/A** error.
*   **Context:** This is a very common error when using **lookup functions** in Excel, such as **VLOOKUP** and **XLOOKUP**.
*   **Cause:** The **#N/A** error means "**Not Available**". It occurs when your lookup function **cannot find the lookup value** in the specified lookup range or table.
*   **Example using VLOOKUP:**  Imagine you're using **VLOOKUP** to find a customer name based on a customer ID.
    *   **Error Scenario:** If the customer ID you are looking up **does not exist** in your customer master data table, **VLOOKUP** will return a **#N/A** error.
    *   **Example in Text:** In the video, looking up "Limbo" in a customer master data table resulted in **#N/A** because the correct name in the master data was "Limba".  A simple typo in the lookup value can cause this error.
*   **Modern Alternative to VLOOKUP: XLOOKUP:** The video mentions that if you are using **Office 365**, you should consider using **XLOOKUP** instead of **VLOOKUP**. **XLOOKUP** is a more modern and flexible lookup function. (Links to separate videos on **VLOOKUP** and **XLOOKUP** are mentioned to be in the video description and cards).
*   **Handling #N/A errors with IFNA function:** The **IFNA** function is specifically designed to handle **#N/A** errors.
    *   **Syntax:** `IFNA(value, value_if_na)`
    *   `value`: Your formula that might return **#N/A** (like a lookup function).
    *   `value_if_na`: What you want to return specifically if a **#N/A** error occurs.
    *   **Example using IFNA:** `=IFNA(VLOOKUP_formula, "Person doesn't exist")`
        *   If the **VLOOKUP_formula** results in **#N/A**, **IFNA** will return the text "Person doesn't exist" instead of the error.
    *   **IFERROR vs. IFNA:**
        *   **IFERROR:** Handles *any* type of Excel error.
        *   **IFNA:**  *Specifically* handles only **#N/A** errors. If you only want to handle **#N/A** errors and let other errors be displayed, use **IFNA**. If you want to catch *all* errors, use **IFERROR**.

### **Introduction to TEXTSPLIT**

Excel has introduced a fantastic new function called **TEXTSPLIT**. This function addresses a long-standing problem: splitting text.  This is particularly helpful when dealing with text strings that contain:

*   Multiple spaces
*   Multiple commas
*   A mix of different delimiters

Previously, the more complex the splitting requirements, the more complicated and lengthy your Excel formulas would become.  However, **TEXTSPLIT** simplifies this process significantly, handling even complex splitting scenarios with ease.

**TEXTSPLIT** is so powerful that it can be combined with other functions to unlock entirely new possibilities in Excel, enabling tasks that were previously impossible.

Let's dive into how **TEXTSPLIT** works and explore its capabilities.

---

### **Basic Usage: Splitting Text with a Single Delimiter (Comma)**

Let's start with the fundamentals.  Imagine you have a list of skills in a single cell, separated by commas, and you want to split each skill into its own cell.

**Example Scenario:** Skills listed in a single cell, comma-separated.

**Using TEXTSPLIT:**

1.  Start typing `=TEXTSPLIT(`. Excel will suggest the function.
2.  The first argument is **text**, which is the cell containing the text you want to split.  Select the cell.
3.  The next argument is **delimiter**, which specifies how you want to split the text. In this case, it's a comma.  Enter `","` (comma in quotation marks).
4.  Close the bracket `)` and press **Enter**.

```excel
=TEXTSPLIT(A1, ",")
```

This will split the text based on the comma delimiter.

**Addressing Extra Spaces After Delimiters:**

Upon closer inspection of the split results, you might notice extra spaces after each skill. This is because the original text contains a comma *and* a space (`, `) as separators.

**Two Methods to Remove Extra Spaces:**

1.  **Using the TRIM Function:** You can wrap the **TEXTSPLIT** function within the **TRIM** function. **TRIM** removes leading and trailing spaces from text.

    ```excel
    =TRIM(TEXTSPLIT(A1, ","))
    ```

2.  **Adjusting the Delimiter in TEXTSPLIT:** Alternatively, you can modify the delimiter in **TEXTSPLIT** to include both the comma and the space as the delimiter.

    ```excel
    =TEXTSPLIT(A1, ", ")
    ```

    Both methods will achieve the same result: splitting the text and removing the extra spaces.

---

### **Handling Multiple Delimiters**

What happens when your data uses different delimiters? In our example, some people used commas, while others used semicolons to separate skills.  Simply using a comma as a delimiter won't work for everyone.

**The Problem:** Inconsistent delimiters (commas and semicolons) cause incorrect splitting.

**TEXTSPLIT Solution: Using Curly Brackets for Multiple Delimiters**

**TEXTSPLIT** can handle multiple delimiters simultaneously. To do this:

1.  Modify the **delimiter** argument. Instead of a single delimiter, use curly brackets `{}` to define a list of delimiters.
2.  Inside the curly brackets, list each delimiter in quotation marks, separated by commas.

**Example with Comma and Semicolon Delimiters:**

To handle both commas and semicolons (followed by a space), use:

```excel
=TEXTSPLIT(A1, {", ", "; "})
```

**Explanation:**

*   `{", ", "; "}`: This defines an array of delimiters. **TEXTSPLIT** will now split the text wherever it finds either a comma followed by a space, OR a semicolon followed by a space.

**Adding More Delimiters (e.g., Colon):**

You can easily add more delimiters to this list. For example, to also include a colon as a delimiter:

```excel
=TEXTSPLIT(A1, {", ", "; ", ":"})
```

Now, **TEXTSPLIT** will correctly split text using commas, semicolons, or colons (each potentially followed by a space).

---

### **Ignoring Empty Cells**

Consider a scenario where you want to split names into first and last names, but you need to exclude prefixes like "Mr." and "Mrs."

**Scenario:** Splitting names but excluding prefixes.

**Initial TEXTSPLIT (with Space Delimiter):**

```excel
=TEXTSPLIT(A1, " ")
```

This splits the name based on spaces, but it includes "Mr." or "Miss" in the results.

**Treating Prefixes as Delimiters:**

We can treat "Mr" and "Miss" (and similar prefixes) as delimiters themselves. Let's add them to our list of delimiters within curly brackets, along with the space.

```excel
=TEXTSPLIT(A1, {" ", "Mr ", "Miss "})
```

This splits the text using spaces, "Mr ", or "Miss " as delimiters. However, this might result in empty cells in the output where the prefixes were located.

**Using the "ignore\_empty\_cells" Argument:**

**TEXTSPLIT** has optional arguments to customize its behavior. One of these is **ignore\_empty\_cells**.

*   **Syntax:**  After specifying the text and column delimiter, you can add more arguments separated by commas. The argument we need is the fourth one, **ignore\_empty\_cells**.  We need to skip the second and third arguments (row\_delimiter and match\_mode) by using commas as placeholders if we want to directly specify the **ignore\_empty\_cells** argument.

*   **Setting to TRUE:** To ignore empty cells, set **ignore\_empty\_cells** to `TRUE`.

**Final Formula with "ignore\_empty\_cells":**

```excel
=TEXTSPLIT(A1, {" ", "Mr ", "Miss "}, , , TRUE)
```

**Explanation:**

*   `, , , TRUE`: We used three commas as placeholders to skip the `row_delimiter`, `match_mode`, and `pad_with` arguments and directly specify `ignore_empty_cells` as `TRUE`.

This formula will split the names, treat "Mr " and "Miss " as delimiters (effectively removing them), and importantly, ignore any empty cells that might result from this process, giving you clean first and last names.

---

### **Using Column and Row Delimiters**

**Scenario:** You have data in a single cell structured like key-value pairs separated by equal signs (=) for columns and commas for rows, and you want to split this into a table format.

**Example Data:** `Name=John Doe, Age=30, City=New York, Skill=Excel; Skill=Power BI, Skill=Data Analysis`

**Using TEXTSPLIT with Column and Row Delimiters:**

1.  **Column Delimiter:**  The equal sign (`=`) separates the columns (Name, Age, City, Skill).
2.  **Row Delimiter:** The comma and space (`, `) separate the rows.

**TEXTSPLIT Formula:**

```excel
=TEXTSPLIT(A1, "=", ", ")
```

**Explanation:**

*   `"="`: Sets the equal sign as the **column delimiter**.
*   `", "`: Sets the comma and space as the **row delimiter**.

This formula will correctly split the data into a structured table with columns for "Name," "Age," "City," and "Skill," and rows for each record.

---

### **Advanced Example: Sorting Split Text within a Cell**

**Goal:** Take a comma-separated list of skills in a cell, split them, sort them alphabetically, and then rejoin them back into a single cell, comma-separated and sorted.

**Functions to Combine:**

*   **TEXTSPLIT:** To split the skills.
*   **TRIM:** To remove potential leading/trailing spaces after splitting.
*   **SORT:** To sort the split skills alphabetically.
*   **TEXTJOIN:** To rejoin the sorted skills back into a single cell.

**Step-by-Step Formula Construction:**

1.  **Split the Skills (TEXTSPLIT and TRIM):**

    First, split the skills using **TEXTSPLIT**. To handle potential leading spaces after commas, use **TRIM** for each split skill. For simplicity in this example, we will assume only comma delimiters and use TRIM later to handle spaces if needed.

    ```excel
    =TEXTSPLIT(A1, ",")
    ```

2.  **Sort the Split Skills (SORT):**

    Wrap the **TEXTSPLIT** result in the **SORT** function to sort the skills alphabetically.

    ```excel
    =SORT(TEXTSPLIT(A1, ","))
    ```

    By default, **SORT** sorts in ascending order and by rows, which is what we want here. We are sorting the array returned by **TEXTSPLIT**.

3.  **Rejoin the Sorted Skills (TEXTJOIN):**

    Finally, use **TEXTJOIN** to combine the sorted skills back into a single cell, using a comma and space as the delimiter.

    ```excel
    =TEXTJOIN(", ", TRUE, SORT(TEXTSPLIT(A1, ",")))
    ```

    **Explanation of TEXTJOIN Arguments:**

    *   `", "`:  The delimiter to join the skills with (comma and space).
    *   `TRUE`:  **ignore\_empty\_cells** argument set to TRUE (though not strictly necessary in this specific case, it's good practice).
    *   `SORT(TEXTSPLIT(A1, ","))`: The array of sorted skills that **TEXTJOIN** will combine.

**Complete Formula for Sorted, Comma-Separated Skills:**

```excel
=TEXTJOIN(", ", TRUE, SORT(TEXTSPLIT(TRIM(A1), ",")))
```
*(Added TRIM to the input cell A1 to handle potential leading/trailing spaces in the original cell content before splitting)*

This formula effectively splits the skills, sorts them internally, and then presents them as a single, sorted, comma-separated string within a cell.

### **Conclusion: TEXTSPLIT - A Dynamic and Powerful Tool**

As demonstrated, **TEXTSPLIT** is a powerful and versatile function that significantly enhances text manipulation capabilities in Excel.  It acts as a dynamic, formula-based version of the "Text to Columns" feature, but with much greater flexibility and functionality.

**Key Advantages of TEXTSPLIT:**

*   **Handles multiple delimiters:** Easily split text based on various delimiters simultaneously.
*   **Optional arguments:** Offers flexibility with arguments like **ignore\_empty\_cells**, **match\_mode**, and **pad\_with** to customize splitting behavior.
*   **Dynamic:** As a function, **TEXTSPLIT** is dynamic and updates automatically when the source data changes.
*   **Integration with other functions:** Can be combined with functions like **TRIM**, **SORT**, **TEXTJOIN**, and others to perform complex text processing tasks.

**Comparison to "Text to Columns":**

| Feature             | **TEXTSPLIT (Function)** | **Text to Columns (Feature)** |
|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Type**             | Function                  | Feature/Tool                    |
| **Dynamic Updates** | Yes                       | No (static result)             |
| **Formula-Based**    | Yes                       | No                              |
| **Flexibility**      | High                      | Moderate                        |
| **Multiple Delimiters**| Excellent                 | Good                            |

**TEXTSPLIT** opens up a wide range of possibilities for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis within Excel.

**Improving Your Excel Experience: Essential Settings to Review**

**(Video URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLHqGRpGOPk)**

Just like any program, Excel comes with default settings right out of the box. However, these default settings might not always align with your specific workflow and preferences.  To optimize your Excel experience, there are a few key settings you should take a look at and potentially adjust. Let's dive into them!

---

**1. Controlling Cell Movement After Pressing Enter**

*   **The Default Behavior:** By default, when you enter data or a formula into a cell and press **Enter**, Excel automatically moves you down to the next cell. This is a common setting, but it might not always be ideal for everyone.
*   **Scenario:** Imagine you're writing multiple formulas in a single cell and want to copy it down. The default "move down" behavior forces you to navigate back to the original cell after each **Enter** press, which can be inefficient.
*   **Shortcut Solution (Control + Enter):** There's a shortcut – **Control + Enter** – that allows you to stay in the same cell after pressing Enter. However, remembering to use this shortcut every time can be cumbersome.
*   **The Setting to Change:**  You can customize the **Enter** key behavior directly in Excel's settings.
    *   **Navigation Path:** Go to **File > Options > Advanced**.
    *   **Setting Location:** Look for the section titled **"Editing options"**.
    *   **Option: "After pressing Enter, move selection"**.
    *   **Default Setting:**  This is checked by default, and the direction is set to "Down".
    *   **Customization Options:** You can change the direction to:
        *   **Right**
        *   **Up** (the presenter jokes this could be a prank on a colleague)
        *   **Left**
        *   **None (Stay in the same cell)** - To achieve this, **uncheck** the "After pressing Enter, move selection" box.
    *   **Applying the Change:** After unchecking the box (or selecting your preferred direction), click **"OK"**.
*   **Result:** With the box unchecked, pressing **Enter** will now keep you in the same cell, perfect for tasks like copying formulas or entering data that requires staying in place.
*   **Channel Plug (Humorous Aside):**  "By the way, since we're talking about adjusting settings, you should also check your YouTube settings to see if you're subscribed to this channel. This way you don't miss out on any other tips that you might find useful in the future."

**2.  Leveraging Autocomplete for Repetitive Text**

*   **The Problem:** If you frequently type long text, names, or phrases (like company names) across multiple Excel files, repetitive typing can be time-consuming and prone to errors.
*   **Solution: Autocomplete (Autocorrect Options):** Excel's Autocorrect feature can be customized to automatically replace short abbreviations with longer, frequently used text.
*   **Setting it Up:**
    *   **Navigation Path:** Go to **File > Options > Proofing**.
    *   **Access Autocorrect Options:** Click on the button **"Autocorrect Options..."**.
    *   **Autocorrect Dialog Box:** This opens a dialog box with various autocorrect settings, language-dependent lists, and the ability to add your own entries.
    *   **Creating a Custom Autocorrect Entry:**
        *   **"Replace" field:** Type the short abbreviation you want to use (e.g., "op").
        *   **"With" field:** Type the full text you want to be inserted automatically (e.g., "Office Plus Headquarters").
        *   Click **"Add"** to add this entry to the autocorrect list.
        *   Click **"OK"** in the Autocorrect Options dialog box.
        *   Click **"OK"** again in the Excel Options dialog box.
*   **How it Works:** Now, whenever you type your abbreviation (e.g., "op") followed by a space, Excel will automatically replace it with your defined full text (e.g., "Office Plus Headquarters").
*   **Global Setting:** This autocomplete setting is a global Excel setting, meaning it works across all your Excel workbooks, not just the current one.
*   **Example Demonstration:** Opening a new Excel workbook (**Ctrl + N**) and typing "op " (followed by a space) will demonstrate the autocomplete in action, inserting "Office Plus Headquarters".

---

**3.  Customizing Lists for Easy Data Entry (Custom Lists)**

*   **Understanding Custom Lists:**  Excel's ability to recognize and extend lists (like months of the year - "January, February, March...") is powered by "Custom Lists". These are predefined lists that Excel understands for auto-filling.
*   **Beyond Predefined Lists:** You are not limited to just months or days of the week. You can create your own custom lists for anything you frequently use in your spreadsheets, such as department names, product categories, employee names, etc.
*   **Setting Up Custom Lists:**
    *   **Navigation Path:** Go to **File > Options > Advanced**.
    *   **Scroll Down:** Scroll down to the **"General"** section.
    *   **Access Custom Lists:** Click on the button **"Edit Custom Lists..."**.
    *   **Custom Lists Dialog Box:** This dialog box displays predefined lists and allows you to add your own.
    *   **Adding a New Custom List:**
        *   **Method 1: Manual Entry:** In the "List entries" area on the right, type each item in your list, pressing **Enter** after each item. Then click **"Add"**.
        *   **Method 2: Importing from Cells:** If your list is already in Excel cells, you can import it.
            *   Click on the **"Import list from cells"** icon (it looks like a spreadsheet).
            *   Select the range of cells containing your list (including headers if desired, as demonstrated with "Department").
            *   Click the **"Import"** button. The list will be added to the "Custom lists" box.
        *   Click **"OK"** in the Custom Lists dialog box.
        *   Click **"OK"** again in the Excel Options dialog box.
*   **Using Custom Lists:**
    *   Type the first item from your custom list in a cell (e.g., "Department" or "Athletics").
    *   Use the fill handle (the small square at the bottom right of the cell) to drag down or across. Excel will automatically fill in the subsequent items from your custom list.
    *   If you drag beyond the end of your list, it will start repeating from the beginning.
*   **Global Application:** Custom lists are a global Excel setting and will be available in all your workbooks.
*   **Example Demonstration:** Typing "Department" and dragging down populates the custom department list. Starting with "Athletics" or "Admin" and dragging down also correctly populates the list from the respective starting point, demonstrating the cyclical nature of the list.  The presenter notes you can exclude the header "Department" when importing if you don't want it in the list itself.

---

**4. Defining Your Preferred Pivot Table Layout (Default Pivot Table Layout)**

*   **Default Pivot Table Annoyances:** Excel's default pivot table layout might require you to make repetitive manual adjustments every time you create a new pivot table. Common adjustments include:
    *   Changing the **Report Layout** to "Tabular Form".
    *   Removing **Subtotals**.
    *   Removing **Grand Totals** (though not explicitly mentioned as always being removed, it's in the context of customizations).
    *   Turning off **"Show +/- buttons"** (field list buttons).
    *   Disabling **"Autofit column widths on update"** to prevent column width changes during refreshes.
*   **Solution: Custom Default Pivot Table Layout (Office 365 Feature):** If you have Office 365, you can define a custom default layout for all new pivot tables, eliminating the need for manual adjustments each time.
*   **Setting the Default Layout:**
    *   **Navigation Path:** Go to **File > Options > Data**.
    *   **Access PivotTable Default Layout Settings:** Look for the section **"Data Options"** and click on **"Edit Default Layout..."** button (labeled as "Make changes to the default layout of PivotTables").
    *   **"Edit Default Layout" Dialog Box:** This dialog box allows you to customize various aspects of the default pivot table layout.
        *   **Manual Customization:** You can manually set preferences for:
            *   **Subtotals:** Show at bottom of group, Do not show.
            *   **Grand Totals:** For Rows and Columns, For Rows Only, For Columns Only, Off.
            *   **Report Layout:** Compact Form, Outline Form, Tabular Form.
            *   **PivotTable Options:**  Clicking this button opens the standard **PivotTable Options** dialog where you can, importantly, uncheck **"Autofit column widths on update"**.
        *   **Importing Layout from Existing Pivot Table:** If you've already created a pivot table with your desired layout, you can import its settings.
            *   Click the **"Import"** button.
            *   Excel will import the layout settings from the currently selected pivot table (make sure you have a pivot table selected in your workbook before clicking "Import").
        *   Click **"OK"** in the "Edit Default Layout" dialog box.
        *   Click **"OK"** again in the Excel Options dialog box.
*   **Applying the Default Layout:**  After setting the default layout, any new pivot table you insert will automatically use these settings.
*   **Example Demonstration:** Inserting a new pivot table (via **Insert > PivotTable**) after setting the default layout shows that the new pivot table reflects the customized layout (tabular form, subtotals off, autofit off).
*   **Customizing Pivot Table Styles (Design Tab):** While not part of the default *layout* setting, the presenter mentions customizing **PivotTable Styles** (found under the **"Design"** tab when a pivot table is selected). You can:
    *   Choose from predefined styles.
    *   Customize a style based on your brand colors.
    *   **Set a Style as Default:** Right-click on a style and choose **"Set as Default"**. This makes the chosen style the default for the current spreadsheet, *not* globally across all workbooks (clarification provided to distinguish from the layout default).

---

**Bonus Settings (Beyond the Initial Four)**

**5.  Controlling the Excel Startup Screen (Startup Options)**

*   **Default Startup Screen:** By default, when you open the Excel application, you are presented with the Excel startup screen. This screen typically shows:
    *   Recent workbooks.
    *   Options to create a "Blank Workbook".
    *   Options to "Open" existing workbooks.
*   **Alternative Workflow:** Some users prefer to bypass this startup screen and directly open Excel to a blank workbook, especially if they primarily navigate files through File Explorer.
*   **Disabling the Startup Screen:**
    *   **Navigation Path:** Go to **File > Options > General**.
    *   **Scroll Down:** Scroll down to the **"Startup options"** section.
    *   **Option: "Show the Start screen when this application starts"**.
    *   **Default Setting:** This box is checked by default.
    *   **To Disable Startup Screen:** **Uncheck** the box "Show the Start screen when this application starts".
    *   Click **"OK"**.
*   **Result:** Now, when you open the Excel application, it will directly open a blank workbook, skipping the startup screen.

---

**6.  Managing Automatic Data Conversion (New Beta Feature - Office Insiders)**

*   **New Feature (Beta - Office Insiders):**  A brand-new feature, currently in beta for Office Insiders, allows more control over Excel's automatic data conversion behaviors. You may not have this feature yet if you are not on the Office Insider program.
*   **Accessing Automatic Data Conversion Settings:**
    *   **Navigation Path:** Go to **File > Options > Advanced**.
    *   **Scroll Down:** Scroll down to find the new section **"Automatic Data Conversion"**.
*   **Key Settings within Automatic Data Conversion:**
    *   **"Removing leading zeros when you're entering numbers"**: Addresses the common issue of Excel automatically removing leading zeros from numbers like product codes and phone numbers. (Specific control over this behavior is implied but not fully detailed in the provided text).
    *   **"When loading a .csv file or similar file, notify me of automatic data conversions"**: This setting is highlighted as particularly useful and should be checked by default once you have access to this feature.
*   **Impact of "Notify me..." Setting:**
    *   **Scenario: Opening a CSV file with leading zeros:** When opening a CSV file containing numbers with leading zeros (e.g., product codes), with this setting enabled, Excel will display a notification.
    *   **Notification Message:** The notification informs you that "by default, Excel will perform the following data conversions in this file," specifically mentioning "removing the leading zeros."
    *   **Choice to Prevent Conversion:** The notification gives you the option to **"choose not to convert"**.
    *   **Default (Old) Behavior vs. New Feature:**
        *   **Old Default (without notification):** Excel would automatically remove leading zeros without warning, potentially causing data errors.
        *   **New Feature (with notification):** You are notified of the automatic conversion and can choose to prevent it, preserving the leading zeros.
*   **Example Demonstration:** Opening a CSV file with product codes (some with leading zeros) triggers the notification. Choosing "not to convert" ensures the leading zeros are preserved when the file is opened in Excel.
*   **Benefit:** This new feature helps prevent unintentional data loss or errors caused by automatic data conversions, especially when dealing with CSV files containing specific number formats like product codes or identifiers that rely on leading zeros.

**Scenario: The Boss's Email & The Quick Task**

Imagine this: You've just started your workday, and you open your email to find a message from your boss. The email simply says, "See attachment and provide: Quick summary, How tobacco's doing, and something I should know."

You open the attached file and think to yourself, "You know what? Let me quickly knock this out before I even grab a coffee, because it looks like it should be that fast."  What makes this task so quick and painless? It's a fantastic feature in Excel called **Analyze Data**.

---

**Introducing "Analyze Data" in Excel**

This incredibly helpful feature is conveniently located right on the **Home tab** in Excel.

*   **Locating the Feature:**  Look for **Analyze Data** on the **Home tab** of your Excel ribbon.

**Understanding the Data Set**

Let's take a look at the data we're working with in this example.

*   **Data Overview:**
    *   We have a dataset with just over **200 rows** of data.
    *   Each column has a clear header.
    *   The columns are: **Category**, **Vendor**, **Date**, and **Cost**.
    *   **Date Format:** Data is collected on a **monthly basis**, with the first day of each month indicated.

**Traditional Pivot Tables vs. "Analyze Data"**

Thinking about creating a report using traditional methods?

*   **Pivot Table Creation (Traditional Approach):**
    *   You'd have to manually consider:
        *   "Where do I go to insert a pivot table?"
        *   "What fields should I drag to the rows?"
        *   "What fields should I drag to the values or columns?"
    *   This process involves considerable mental effort, especially first thing in the morning!

**The Simplicity of "Analyze Data"**

Thankfully, Excel provides **Analyze Data** to simplify this process significantly.

*   **Using "Analyze Data":**
    1.  Simply select **Analyze Data**.
    2.  Excel automatically picks up the correct data range.
    3.  You are then presented with options to:
        *   **Ask a question about your data.**
        *   **Choose from suggested questions or insights** that Excel provides.

---

**Exploring Suggested Insights and Questions**

Let's see what **Analyze Data** suggests for our dataset.

*   **Initial Suggestions:**
    *   **"Cost by Date"**:
        *   Excel suggests a pivot table showing "Cost by Date."
        *   You can easily **insert this as a pivot table**.
        *   The suggested table includes "Date" and "Sum of Cost."
        *   Number formatting appears to be automatically applied correctly.
    *   **"Cost by Category"**:
        *   Another suggestion is "Cost by Category."
        *   You can **insert this as a pivot chart**.
        *   The chart will be placed on a **separate sheet**.

*   **Additional Insights:**
    *   **Vendor-Specific Insights:**
        *   "For Vendor: Treasury Wine Estate, cost decreases over time." - This is highlighted as potentially interesting.
        *   "Also for this vendor, cost decreases over time." -  Another instance of the same insight.
        *   Clicking "Show More" can reveal even more insights that might be unexpected or require further investigation.

---

**Creating the Summary Report for the Boss**

The immediate task is to provide a summary for the boss. Let's utilize the insights from **Analyze Data**.

*   **Inserting the "Cost by Date" Pivot Table (Summary Start):**
    1.  Insert the "Cost by Date" pivot table suggestion.
    2.  A new sheet is created with the pivot table showing "Date" and "Sum of Cost."
    3.  Rename "Sum of Cost" to "Total Cost" for clarity.

*   **Adding Average Cost to the Pivot Table:**
    1.  The boss is also interested in the average cost.
    2.  Since the pivot table is already created, adding average cost is simple.
    3.  **Steps to Add Average Cost:**
        *   Drag the "Cost" field again and drop it into the "Values" area of the PivotTable Fields pane.
        *   You now have "Sum of Cost" twice.
        *   For the second "Sum of Cost," change the aggregation to "Average."
        *   **How to change to Average:** Double-click on the second "Sum of Cost" in the Values area, select "Average" as the calculation type, rename the field to "Average Cost," and click "OK."
        *   Update the number formatting for "Average Cost" to include thousand separators and appropriate decimal places (Right-click, Number Format, Number, Use 1000 Separator).

---

**Creating "Average Cost by Category" Chart**

Let's fulfill the request for a chart showing cost by category, specifically average cost.

*   **Asking a Specific Question:**
    1.  Go back to **Analyze Data**.
    2.  In the question box, type: "Average Cost by Category."
    3.  **Analyze Data** understands the request and generates a pivot chart.

*   **Changing Chart Type (Column Chart):**
    1.  To get a column chart, ask: "Average Cost by Category as a Column Chart."
    2.  **Analyze Data** successfully provides the requested column chart.
    3.  Insert this pivot chart.
    4.  A new sheet is created with the pivot chart and its underlying pivot table.
    5.  **Consolidating to Summary Sheet:** Cut the chart (Ctrl+X) and paste it into your intended "Summary" sheet.
    6.  The underlying pivot table data can be kept separate (potentially hidden later) for data integrity.
    7.  Update the chart title to "Average Cost by Category" for clarity.

---

**Adding a "Cost Trend" Line Chart**

Let's also include a line chart to visualize the cost trend over time.

*   **Asking for Cost Trend:**
    1.  Go back to **Analyze Data**.
    2.  Type in the question box: "Cost Trend."
    3.  **Analyze Data** suggests "Cost over Months," which is suitable.
    4.  Insert this pivot chart.
    5.  Cut and paste the "Cost Trend" chart into the "Summary" sheet to consolidate all visuals.

*   **Formatting and Clean Up:**
    *   Format the charts as needed to improve visual presentation and clarity.
    *   Arrange all charts and tables within the "Summary" sheet for a cohesive report.
    *   Remove or hide any unnecessary sheets (like the separate sheets initially created for each chart) to keep the workbook organized.

---

**Investigating "Tobacco" Specific Insights**

The boss specifically asked about "tobacco." Let's use **Analyze Data** to get insights on this category.

*   **Focusing on "Tobacco":**
    1.  Go back to **Analyze Data**.
    2.  In the question box, type or select "Tobacco" (selecting from suggestions might be easier).
    3.  Ask for "Insights" related to tobacco.

*   **Tobacco Category Insight:**
    *   "For category tobacco, February had the maximum cost." - This is identified as a key insight.
    *   The insight is visually reinforced with conditional formatting, highlighting the maximum point on the chart.
    *   Insert the suggested pivot chart for this insight.

*   **Tobacco Vendor Cost Breakdown:**
    1.  Ask **Analyze Data**: "Tobacco Vendor Cost Breakdown."
    2.  The resulting chart appears sorted.
    3.  To sort differently (ascending), ask: "Sorted Ascending."
    4.  **Analyze Data** understands and re-sorts.
    5.  Insert the pivot table for "Tobacco Vendor Cost Breakdown."
    6.  Notice that the "Category" filter in this pivot table is automatically set to "Tobacco" – a helpful feature.

---

**General "Cost Insights" and Threshold-Based Analysis**

Let's explore more general cost insights and even set thresholds.

*   **General "Cost Insights":**
    1.  Go back to **Analyze Data**.
    2.  Select the suggested "Insights for Cost" (which might be similar to insights seen earlier).
    3.  Explore the provided insights, such as "Frequency of Cost."
    4.  Identify interesting insights and insert their corresponding pivot charts or tables.

*   **Threshold-Based Analysis (Vendors Above 7 Million Cost):**
    1.  Ask **Analyze Data**: "Vendors with Costs Higher than 7 million."
    2.  **Analyze Data** correctly interprets "7 million."
    3.  Insert the resulting pivot table, which shows vendors exceeding the specified cost threshold.
    4.  Also, consider inserting other insightful charts or tables generated by **Analyze Data** to further enrich the report.

---

**Dynamic Nature and Data Updates**

A crucial question: Are these reports dynamic? What happens when the underlying data changes?

*   **Testing Data Dynamism:**
    1.  Go back to the original data sheet.
    2.  Find an entry for "Food" category and change the "Cost" value by adding an extra zero (significantly increasing it).
    3.  Excel immediately detects data changes and indicates it is "re-analyzing my data."

*   **Updating Pivot Tables and Charts:**
    1.  To update the pivot tables and charts based on data changes, you need to manually refresh them.
    2.  **Refreshing Pivot Tables:** Right-click within any pivot table and select "Refresh."
    3.  Upon refresh, all related pivot tables and charts, including those in the "Summary" sheet, will update to reflect the changed data.

*   **Best Practice for Dynamic Data Ranges:**
    *   To ensure automatic updates when adding new data rows, format your data range as an official **Excel Table**.
    *   **How to Format as Table:** Select your data range and use "Format as Table" option in Excel.
    *   When using an Excel Table as the data source for pivot tables, adding new data rows to the table will automatically be included in the pivot table's data range upon refresh, without needing to manually update the range.

---

## **Introduction: Finding Duplicates in Excel - Four Methods**

A common challenge in Excel is identifying duplicate data. Duplicates can exist within a single column, across two columns being compared, or as entire duplicate rows.  Sometimes, simply highlighting duplicates isn't enough; you might need a dynamic formula to extract the duplicate values.

This guide will demonstrate **four distinct methods** to find duplicates in Excel, allowing you to choose the approach that best suits your specific needs.

---

## **Method 1: Highlighting Duplicates in Two Columns Using Conditional Formatting**

This method is ideal when you want to compare two columns and visually highlight any overlapping entries.  Let's consider an example with product codes in "Segment One" and "Segment Two" columns, where we want to find product codes present in both segments.

**Steps:**

1.  **Select the Data Ranges:**
    *   Highlight the product codes in **Segment One**.
        *   Use the shortcut key: **Ctrl + Shift + Down**
    *   Hold down **Ctrl** and click on the first cell in **Segment Two**.
    *   Highlight the product codes in **Segment Two**.
        *   Use the shortcut key: **Ctrl + Shift + Down**
    *   You should now have both ranges selected simultaneously.

2.  **Apply Conditional Formatting:**
    *   Go to the **Home** tab on the Excel ribbon.
    *   Click on **Conditional Formatting** in the Styles group.
    *   Select **Highlight Cell Rules**.
    *   Choose **Duplicate Values**.

3.  **Customize Formatting (Optional):**
    *   In the "Format cells that contain" dialog box, ensure "**Duplicate**" is selected (the default option). You can switch to "**Unique**" if you need to highlight unique values instead.
    *   Choose a pre-defined highlighting style from the dropdown menu, or:
        *   Click on "**Custom Format...**" to create your own formatting style (e.g., different fill color, font style, etc.).
    *   For this example, we will use the **yellow fill** preset.

4.  **Apply and View Results:**
    *   Click **OK** in the "Duplicate Values" dialog box.
    *   Excel will now highlight the duplicate values that are present in both **Segment One** and **Segment Two** columns.

**Important Note:** This method works even if the data is in separate columns or within the same column.

---

## **Method 2: Finding Duplicate Rows Using Conditional Formatting and a Helper Column**

This method addresses the scenario where you need to identify entire rows that are duplicates, not just individual cell values.  Simply using the "Duplicate Values" rule directly will compare cells individually, not entire rows.

**The Problem with Direct "Duplicate Values" for Rows:**

Applying "Conditional Formatting > Highlight Cell Rules > Duplicate Values" directly to a range of rows will evaluate each cell independently. This is not what we want when looking for duplicate *rows*.

**Solution: Using the CONCAT Function to Create a Unique Key**

To compare entire rows, we can create a helper column that concatenates (joins) the values from each cell in a row into a single string. This string acts as a unique key for each row, allowing us to identify duplicate rows based on these keys.

**Steps:**

1.  **Insert a Helper Column:**
    *   Insert a new column next to your data. This column will be used for the unique keys.

2.  **Use the CONCAT Function:**
    *   In the first cell of the helper column (e.g., if your data starts in row 4, and you inserted the helper column in column C, start in C4), enter the **CONCAT** formula.
    *   The formula should combine the values of all cells in the corresponding row. For example, if your data columns are A and B, the formula in C4 would be:  `=CONCAT(A4,B4)`
    *   Drag the fill handle (the small square at the bottom-right of the cell) down to apply the formula to all rows. This generates a unique key for each row.

3.  **Apply Conditional Formatting to the Helper Column:**
    *   Select the range of unique keys you just created in the helper column.
    *   Go to **Home > Conditional Formatting > Highlight Cell Rules > Duplicate Values**.
    *   Choose your desired formatting (e.g., yellow fill) and click **OK**.  This will highlight the duplicate unique keys.

4.  **Hide the Helper Column (Optional):**
    *   To hide the helper column containing the unique keys for a cleaner look:
        *   Select the helper column.
        *   Press **Ctrl + 1** (or right-click on the column header and select **Format Cells**).
        *   Go to the **Number** tab.
        *   Select **Custom** in the Category list.
        *   In the "Type" field, enter three semicolons: `;;;`
        *   Click **OK**. This custom formatting hides the values in the helper column without deleting them.

5.  **Observe the Highlighted Rows:**
    *   The rows corresponding to the highlighted unique keys are the duplicate rows.

---

## **Method 3: Using Formulas (COUNTIF and CONCAT) to Identify Duplicates**

Instead of just highlighting, you might need formulas to return specific values related to duplicates, like TRUE/FALSE or the count of occurrences.

**Example 3a: Finding Duplicate Products in a Single Column**

Let's say you have a "Product" column and want to know if each product appears more than once in that column.

**Steps:**

1.  **Use the COUNTIF Function:**
    *   In a helper column next to your "Product" column, enter the **COUNTIF** formula.
    *   For the first cell (e.g., if product names start in B4, put the formula in C4), the formula would be: `=COUNTIF($B$4:$B$10,B4)` (assuming your product list goes from B4 to B10).
        *   **`$B$4:$B$10`** is the **range** to search within (the entire product column). The dollar signs ($) make this an absolute reference, so it doesn't change when you drag the formula down.
        *   **`B4`** is the **criteria** – the cell you are checking the count for (the product name in the current row).
    *   Press **Enter** and drag the fill handle down to apply the formula to all product rows.

2.  **Interpret the COUNTIF Results:**
    *   The **COUNTIF** formula returns the number of times each product name appears in the product column.
    *   A value of **1** means the product is unique (appears once).
    *   A value greater than **1** indicates a duplicate (appears multiple times).

3.  **(Optional) Convert to TRUE/FALSE:**
    *   If you want to return **TRUE** for duplicates and **FALSE** for unique items, modify the formula to check if the count is greater than 1: `=COUNTIF($B$4:$B$10,B4)>1`
    *   This formula will now return **TRUE** for duplicate products and **FALSE** for unique ones.

**Example 3b: Finding Duplicate Rows Using CONCAT and COUNTIF**

Similar to Method 2, we can use **CONCAT** to create unique row keys and then use **COUNTIF** to count the occurrences of these keys.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create a Helper Column with CONCAT (Unique Keys):**
    *   Follow steps 1 and 2 from **Method 2** to create a helper column with unique keys for each row using the **CONCAT** function.

2.  **Use COUNTIF on the Unique Keys:**
    *   In another helper column (or the same one if you prefer to overwrite the CONCAT keys), use the **COUNTIF** function to count the occurrences of each unique key within the range of all unique keys.
    *   For example, if your unique keys are in column C (from C4 to C10), and you put the COUNTIF formula in column D (starting in D4), the formula would be: `=COUNTIF($C$4:$C$10,C4)`
    *   Drag the formula down.

3.  **Interpret COUNTIF Results (as in Example 3a):**
    *   Values greater than **1** in the COUNTIF column indicate duplicate rows.

4.  **(Optional) Visual Indicator (Emoji Example):**
    *   You can use an **IF** statement to display a visual indicator (like an emoji) for duplicate rows instead of numbers.
    *   For example, to display a specific emoji for duplicates and nothing for unique rows: `=IF(COUNTIF($C$4:$C$10,C4)>1,"✅","")` (You can replace "✅" with any emoji using the **Windows Key + Period (.)** or **Windows Key + Semicolon (;)** shortcut to open the emoji panel).

5.  **(Optional) Hide Helper Columns:**
    *   You can hide the helper columns (containing CONCAT keys and/or COUNTIF results) as described in **Method 2, Step 4** for a cleaner presentation.
    *   Alternatively, you can **group** the helper columns for easy hiding and unhiding:
        *   Select the helper columns.
        *   Use the shortcut key: **Shift + Alt + Right Arrow Key**. This will group the columns. You can collapse the group using the "-" sign above the column headers to hide them.

---

## **Method 4: Returning a List of Duplicate Rows Using the FILTER and SORT Functions**

If you need to extract the duplicate rows into a separate list, the **FILTER** function is very powerful. Combined with **SORT**, you can present a clean, sorted list of duplicates.

**Steps:**

1.  **Ensure You Have Unique Keys (Helper Column with CONCAT):**
    *   It's highly recommended to have a helper column with unique row keys created using the **CONCAT** function as described in **Method 2, Step 2**. This simplifies the **FILTER** formula.

2.  **Use the FILTER Function:**
    *   In a new location in your worksheet where you want the list of duplicate rows to appear, enter the **FILTER** function.
    *   The basic structure of the **FILTER** function is: `FILTER(array, include, [if_empty])`
        *   **`array`**: The range of data you want to filter (your entire data table, including headers if desired).
        *   **`include`**: A logical array (TRUE/FALSE values) that determines which rows to include in the result. We will use **COUNTIF** here to create this logical array.
        *   **`[if_empty]`** (optional):  The value to return if no rows meet the criteria. We can use `""` (empty string) to return nothing if no duplicates are found.

3.  **Construct the FILTER Formula with COUNTIF:**
    *   Assuming your data is in columns A and B, and your unique keys are in column C (from C4 to C10), and you want to output the duplicate rows starting from cell E1, the formula in E1 could be:
        `=FILTER(A4:B10,COUNTIF(C4:C10,C4:C10)>1,"")`
        *   **`A4:B10`** is the **`array`** – the data range to be filtered (adjust to your actual data range).
        *   **`COUNTIF(C4:C10,C4:C10)>1`** is the **`include`** argument. This part uses **COUNTIF** to check for each unique key in column C if its count within column C is greater than 1. This generates a TRUE/FALSE array where TRUE corresponds to duplicate rows.
        *   **`""`** is the **`if_empty`** argument, returning an empty string if no duplicates are found.

4.  **Apply the SORT Function (Optional):**
    *   To sort the list of duplicate rows, you can wrap the **FILTER** function within the **SORT** function.
    *   To sort by the first column of the duplicate list (e.g., column E in our example), use:
        `=SORT(FILTER(A4:B10,COUNTIF(C4:C10,C4:C10)>1,""),1)`
        *   **`1`** in the **SORT** function specifies to sort by the first column. The default sort order is ascending.

5.  **View the List of Duplicate Rows:**
    *   Excel will dynamically display the list of duplicate rows in the location where you entered the formula. If you used the **SORT** function, the list will be sorted by the first column.

## Part 2:  Optimizing Your Excel to PDF Output with Page Setup

While the basic conversion methods are useful, you might encounter issues when printing specific sections or formatting your Excel data into a professional-looking PDF.

**Scenario:** Let's say you want to print three specific tabs from your Excel workbook, but you have specific formatting requirements for each:

*   **"Training" Tab:** You want to exclude areas with a dark gray background and only include the white data area in the PDF.
*   **"Report" Tab:** You want this to be in **landscape** format.
*   **Third Tab (Data Sheet):** This sheet is in **vertical** format, but the data spans multiple pages. You want to ensure the **column headers** are visible on every page.

**Problem with Default PDF Output:** If you simply select these three tabs and use one of the methods described above, you might end up with a PDF that is not ideal.

*   **Example of an unprofessional PDF:** The speaker describes a poorly formatted PDF:
    *   Data values are cut off.
    *   No page numbers are included.
    *   It looks unprofessional and gives the impression of incompetence.

**Solution: Mastering "Page Setup"**

The key to creating professional PDFs from Excel is using the "**Page Setup**" options. This allows you to make necessary corrections and customize your PDF output.

Let's walk through how to use Page Setup to fix the issues mentioned above for each sheet.

###  Customizing the "Training" Tab (Print Area & Scale to Fit)

**Issue:**  The "Training" tab includes unwanted gray cells and spans across multiple pages unnecessarily.

**Solution:** Use "**Print Area**" to define the specific data range and "**Scale to Fit**" to ensure it fits on a single page (if desired).

1.  **Define the Print Area:**
    *   Go to the "**Page Layout**" tab on the Excel ribbon.
    *   In the "**Page Setup**" group, find "**Print Area**".
    *   **Before** clicking on "**Print Area**", you need to **select the range of cells** you want to include in the PDF.
    *   Zoom out in Excel to easily select the desired area.
    *   Select the specific data area (e.g., the white area excluding the gray cells).
    *   Click on "**Print Area**" and choose "**Set Print Area**".

2.  **Verify Print Area in Print Preview:**
    *   Go to **File** > **Print** (or **Ctrl + P**) to open **Print Preview**.
    *   Confirm that the gray cells are no longer included.

3.  **Scale to Fit on a Single Page (Optional):**
    *   In the "**Scaling**" section of the "**Page Setup**" group (still under the "**Page Layout**" tab), find "**Scale to Fit**".
    *   By default, "**Scale**" is set to **100%**, and "**Width**" and "**Height**" are set to "**Automatic**".
    *   To force the content to fit on a single page, you can set:
        *   **Width:** to **1 page**
        *   **Height:** to **1 page**
    *   Excel will automatically adjust the "**Scale**" percentage to fit the content within these dimensions.
    *   **Caution:** Be mindful of the scale percentage. If it becomes too low, the text might become too small and difficult to read.

4.  **Add Page Numbers:**
    *   In the "**Page Setup**" group, click the small arrow in the bottom right corner to open the full "**Page Setup**" dialog box.
    *   Go to the "**Header/Footer**" tab.
    *   Under "**Footer**", choose "**Custom Footer...**" or select a pre-defined option like "Page 1 of ?". For this example, the presenter selects "Page 1 of question mark" from the dropdown.
    *   Click "**OK**".
    *   Review in "**Print Preview**" to see the page numbers. (Page numbers will display correctly when multiple sheets are selected for printing).

### Customizing the "Report" Tab (Orientation, Print Titles, Page Breaks)

**Issue:** The "Report" tab is in portrait orientation, cutting off columns and making it hard to read. Also, when it spans multiple pages, the first two columns (containing app names) are not repeated, losing context.

**Solutions:** Use "**Orientation**" to change to landscape, "**Print Titles**" to repeat columns, and "**Page Breaks**" to control page division.

1.  **Change Orientation to Landscape:**
    *   In the "**Page Setup**" group of the "**Page Layout**" tab, click on "**Orientation**".
    *   Select "**Landscape**".

2.  **Set Print Titles to Repeat Columns:**
    *   In the "**Page Setup**" group, click on "**Print Titles**".
    *   In the "**Print Titles**" dialog box, find the "**Columns to repeat at left**" field.
    *   Click the button to the right of the field to select the columns directly on the sheet.
    *   Select the **first two columns** (containing app names).
    *   The selected column range will appear in the field (e.g., `$A:$B`).

3.  **Add Page Numbers (Again):**
    *   While still in the "**Page Setup**" dialog box (from "**Print Titles**" or re-open it via the arrow in the "**Page Setup**" group), go to the "**Header/Footer**" tab.
    *   Activate page numbers in the "**Footer**" section, as done previously.
    *   Click "**OK**".

4.  **Insert Page Breaks for Better Layout (Optional):**
    *   **Problem:** The initial landscape view might have too much data on the first page and very little on subsequent pages.
    *   **Solution:** Insert a **Page Break** to control where the content splits onto new pages.
    *   Select the **column** where you want the page break to occur (e.g., to separate January data from subsequent months). Select the column *to the left* of where you want the break.
    *   Go to the "**Breaks**" dropdown in the "**Page Setup**" group (under "**Page Layout**" tab).
    *   Select "**Insert Page Break**".

5.  **Review and Adjust Page Breaks (Page Break Preview):**
    *   Go to the "**View**" tab on the Excel ribbon.
    *   In the "**Workbook Views**" group, click on "**Page Break Preview**".
    *   Excel will display the page breaks visually.
    *   You can **adjust** page breaks by **dragging** the blue dashed lines to reposition them as needed.
    *   Return to "**Normal**" view (under "**View**" tab, "**Workbook Views**" group) when finished adjusting page breaks.

### Customizing the Third Tab (Repeating Rows for Headers)

**Issue:** The third tab spans multiple pages vertically, and the column headers are lost on subsequent pages.

**Solution:** Use "**Print Titles**" to repeat the header rows at the top of each page.

1.  **Set Print Titles to Repeat Rows:**
    *   Go to the "**Page Layout**" tab and click on "**Print Titles**".
    *   In the "**Print Titles**" dialog box, find the "**Rows to repeat at top**" field.
    *   Click the button to the right of the field and select the **header rows** directly on the sheet.
    *   Select the rows containing your column headers.
    *   The selected row range will appear in the field (e.g., `$1:$2`).

2.  **Add Page Numbers (Again):**
    *   Ensure page numbers are activated in the "**Header/Footer**" tab of the "**Page Setup**" dialog box, as done previously.
    *   Click "**OK**".

###  Reviewing All Sheets Together and Final PDF Output

1.  **Select All Sheets for Printing:**
    *   Hold down the **Control** key and click on each of the three sheet tabs ("Training," "Report," and the third data sheet).
2.  **Open Print Preview for All Selected Sheets:**
    *   Press **Ctrl + P** to access the **Print Preview**.
    *   Navigate through the pages using the navigation controls in the Print Preview window.
    *   Verify that:
        *   Page numbers are present and sequential.
        *   Landscape and portrait orientations are applied correctly to respective sheets.
        *   Repeated columns and rows are displayed as intended on multi-page sheets.
        *   Page breaks are positioned correctly.
        *   The overall layout is professional and readable.

3.  **Print to PDF:**
    *   Once satisfied with the Print Preview, you can choose your preferred method to create the PDF:
        *   Click "**Print**" and select "**Microsoft Print to PDF**" from the printer dropdown.
        *   Use "**File** > **Export** > **Create PDF/XPS Document**".
        *   Use "**File** > **Save As**" and choose "**PDF (*.pdf)**" as the file type.
    *   Name your PDF file (e.g., "Nice Report").
    *   Click "**Save**" or "**Publish**" (depending on the method chosen).

4.  **Review the Final PDF File:**
    *   Open the generated PDF file and check that everything is as expected.

**Welcome to Excel Time Savers!**

**(Video URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uIxy9auP_o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uIxy9auP_o))**

Hello everyone, Leila here, welcome back to the channel! Get ready to reclaim your time because today, we are diving deep into some amazing **Excel Time Savers**. I'm excited to show you **five hidden features** that are perfect for busy people like you. Trust me, these are features you might not know you need yet, but once you see them in action, you absolutely won't be able to live without them! So, let's not waste another moment and jump straight into it.

### **1. Quick Jump Bookmarks**

Excel unfortunately doesn't have a built-in bookmark feature, which is something I personally wish it did. However, there's a really **cool trick** you can use to achieve the same result. This is especially beneficial for those larger workbooks that are packed with numerous tabs.

**The Problem:**

*   Imagine you frequently need to navigate to specific locations within a large Excel file.
*   For instance, you might regularly need to access the **"Final" tab** and scroll down to a particular section with important data.
*   Each time you open the workbook, it defaults to a different location, forcing you to:
    1.  Scroll to locate the correct tab.
    2.  Click on the tab.
    3.  Scroll again to find the specific cell or area you need.

**The Solution: Using the Name Box as a Bookmark**

You can eliminate this repetitive navigation by creating a "bookmark" for your desired location. Here’s how:

**Steps to Create a Bookmark:**

1.  **Select the target cell:** Go to the exact cell you want to bookmark (e.g., in the "Final" tab, the specific cell with "more important stuff").
2.  **Go to the Name Box:** Locate the **Name Box** – it's the small box on the left side of the formula bar, usually displaying the cell reference (like "A1").
3.  **Type in a bookmark name:** Click into the **Name Box** and type a descriptive name for your bookmark. For example, let's call it **"BookReport"**.
    *   **Important:** Bookmark names cannot contain spaces.
    *   **Naming Convention Tip:** Consider using a consistent prefix for your bookmark names (e.g., "bm\_BookReport") to easily identify them within the Name Box, especially if you use tables or Name Manager for other purposes.
4.  **Press Enter:** After typing the name, press the **Enter** key. This action creates your bookmark.

**How to Use Your Bookmark:**

*   Once created, you can jump to your bookmarked location from anywhere within your workbook.
*   **Method 1: Using the Dropdown:** Click on the dropdown arrow next to the **Name Box**. You will see your bookmark name (**"BookReport"**) listed. Select it, and Excel will instantly take you to the bookmarked cell.
*   **Method 2: Typing the Name:** Alternatively, you can simply type the bookmark name directly into the **Name Box** (e.g., type **"BookReport"**) and press **Enter**. You will be instantly navigated to your bookmarked cell.

**Managing and Deleting Bookmarks:**

Bookmarks created using the Name Box are actually named ranges managed by Excel's **Name Manager**. To delete a bookmark:

1.  Go to the **Formulas** tab on the Excel ribbon.
2.  Click on **Name Manager**.
3.  In the **Name Manager** dialog box, you will see your bookmark listed (e.g., **"BookReport"**).
4.  Select the bookmark you want to delete and click on the **Delete** button.
5.  Confirm the deletion by clicking **OK** in the confirmation prompt.
6.  Click **Close** to exit the **Name Manager**.

**Benefit:** This **Quick Jump Bookmarks** trick is an incredibly efficient way to navigate large Excel workbooks rapidly, saving you valuable time and frustration.

### **2. Analyze Data (Formerly Ideas)**

**Analyze Data**, previously known as **Ideas**, is your quick route to gaining insights and answers directly from your data using the power of **AI**. It's unbelievably fast and user-friendly.

**Scenario:**

*   Imagine you've just received a new dataset.
*   This dataset includes columns like **Month**, **Product**, **Total Sales**, **Units Sold**, **Customer Ratings**, and **Returns** for a year's worth of data.
*   You need to quickly identify the **five products with the lowest customer ratings** across all time periods.

**Traditional Approach vs. Analyze Data:**

Traditionally, you might spend time sorting, filtering, or creating PivotTables to answer this question. However, with **Analyze Data**, it can be done in just a couple of clicks.

**Steps to Use Analyze Data:**

1.  **Select any cell within your data set.**
2.  Go to the **Home** tab on the Excel ribbon.
3.  Click on **Analyze Data** (you might find it towards the right side of the ribbon, in the "Analyzing Data" group).
4.  The **Analyze Data** pane will open on the right. It might automatically suggest some insights, but for a specific question, use the question box at the top of the pane.
5.  **Type your question:** In the question box, type your specific question in natural language. For our example, type: **"Give me 5 products with the lowest customer ratings"**.
6.  **Press Enter:** Hit **Enter**. Analyze Data will process your request.
7.  **Review the Answer:** Analyze Data will display an answer, often in the form of a suggested PivotTable. In our example, it says: **"Showing bottom 5 in 'Product' by average 'Customer Ratings'."**
8.  **Insert PivotTable:** Click on the **"Insert PivotTable"** button (or similar prompt) provided by Analyze Data. This will insert a PivotTable on a new sheet, already configured to answer your question.

**Further Exploration:**

*   **Customize the PivotTable:** You can further adjust the PivotTable using the **PivotTable Fields** pane on the right to refine the analysis or add more dimensions.
*   **Detailed Data:** To see the detailed data for a specific product in the PivotTable (e.g., the product with the lowest rating), simply **double-click** on that product's row in the PivotTable. Excel will create a new sheet containing all the detailed records related to that product.

**Benefit:** **Analyze Data** is like having a **mini data analyst built into Excel**. It empowers you to quickly get answers to your data questions without needing deep knowledge of PivotTables or complex formulas.

**Customizing the Forecast:**

*   **Adjust Forecast End Date:** In the **Forecast Sheet** dialog box, you can adjust the forecast period.
    *   Use the **"Forecast End"** calendar picker to select a specific end date for your forecast (e.g., end of December for the current year).
*   **Options:** Click on the **"Options"** dropdown in the dialog box for further customization.
    *   **Confidence Interval:** The **Confidence Interval** is set to **95%** by default. This means there is a 95% probability that the actual future data points will fall within the upper and lower bounds displayed in the forecast. You can adjust this percentage if needed.
    *   **Seasonality:** **Seasonality** is set to **"Detect automatically"** by default, which is usually accurate. However, you can manually specify the seasonality if you have specific knowledge about it.

5.  **Create Forecast:** Once you are satisfied with the preview and settings, click on the **"Create"** button in the **Forecast Sheet** dialog box.

**Output and Flexibility:**

*   Excel will create a new sheet containing:
    *   A **chart** visualizing your historical and forecasted sales data, including the confidence interval bounds. This is a standard Excel chart, so you can customize its formatting and design as needed.
    *   A **table** of data accompanying the chart, showing the forecasted values, lower confidence bound, and upper confidence bound for each forecasted period.

*   **Dynamic Updates:** The table is directly linked to the chart. If you make any adjustments to the data in the table, the chart will update automatically.

**Benefit:** **One-Click Forecasting** provides a remarkably quick and easy way to generate sales forecasts directly in Excel, saving you significant time and effort compared to manual forecasting methods or using separate forecasting tools.

**Video Introduction to VLOOKUP in Excel**

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDphx23AtqM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDphx23AtqM)

**Why VLOOKUP is Essential for Excel Users**

Here's the thing: if you use **Excel**, you *need* to know **VLOOKUP**. It's the most used **Excel** function out there!

*   **Benefits of using VLOOKUP:**
    *   Automates data analysis.
    *   Saves a ton of time.
    *   Helps avoid errors.
*   **VLOOKUP as the "OG" Lookup Function:**
    *   Works in all **Excel** versions.

**What You Will Learn in This Guide**

By the end of this video, you will understand:

*   **What VLOOKUP is.**
*   **How VLOOKUP works.**
*   **Looking up values from another sheet.**
*   **Performing exact match lookups.**
*   **Performing closest match (approximate) lookups.**
*   **Troubleshooting and solving VLOOKUP errors.**

**This guide is your ultimate VLOOKUP resource!** Pay close attention, as there will be a test at the end to check your understanding.

---

**Section 1: Basic VLOOKUP for Exact Match - Looking Up Related Information**

Let's start with the most common use of **VLOOKUP**: to look up related information from another place and bring it into your current sheet.

**Example Scenario:**

*   We have a list of **customer names** and want to find each customer's **profession**.
*   This profession information is available elsewhere, in a separate data set.

**Data Sets:**

*   **Sheet 1 (Current Sheet):** List of Customer Names (Column A)
*   **Sheet 2 (Data Source):** Customer Names, Phone Number, and Profession (Columns A, B, and C respectively)

**Importance of Automation:**

*   While the example list is short, real-world data can be thousands of rows.
*   Manual lookup, copy, and pasting is inefficient and error-prone.
*   **VLOOKUP** automates this process.

**Steps to Use VLOOKUP for Exact Match:**

1.  **Select the cell** where you want the profession to appear (next to the customer name).
2.  **Start typing the formula:** `=VLOOKUP`
3.  **Use Tab to select VLOOKUP** from the suggestions. This will auto-complete and open the parenthesis: `=VLOOKUP(`
4.  **Understand the Formula Arguments:** **VLOOKUP** requires specific arguments to work correctly.

    *   **`lookup_value`**:  The value you are searching for.
        *   In our example, this is the **customer name** (e.g., "Sid").
        *   Select the cell containing "Sid".
    *   **`table_array`**: The range where **VLOOKUP** should search for the `lookup_value` and find the corresponding result.
        *   This range *must* include both:
            *   The column containing the `lookup_value` (Customer Names).
            *   The column containing the information you want to return (Profession).
        *   Select the range in the data source that contains Customer Names and Professions.
    *   **`col_index_num`**: The column index number within the `table_array` that contains the value to return.
        *   **Excel** counts columns from left to right, starting with 1.
        *   In our example:
            *   Column 1: Customer Names
            *   Column 2: Phone Number
            *   Column 3: Profession
        *   We want to return the **Profession**, which is in the **3rd column**. So, enter `3`.
    *   **`range_lookup`**:  *Optional* argument (indicated by square brackets `[]`). Specifies whether to find an **exact match** or an **approximate match**.
        *   **Default behavior (if omitted):** Approximate match (TRUE).
        *   **For exact match:** You *must* specify `FALSE` or `0`.

5.  **Argument Separator:** Use a comma (`,`) or semicolon (`;`) to separate arguments. This depends on your regional/locale settings in **Excel**.
6.  **Initial Formula (Without Exact Match Specified):** `=VLOOKUP(A2,Sheet2!A:C,3)`  (Assuming "Sid" is in cell A2 and data is in Sheet2, columns A to C).
    *   **Problem:** If you press Enter now, you might get an *incorrect* result because the default is approximate match.
    *   **Example of Incorrect Result:**  "Sid" might be incorrectly identified as "head of procrastination" instead of "keyboard manager".
7.  **Specifying Exact Match:** To ensure the correct result, you *must* add `FALSE` or `0` as the last argument for an exact match.
    *   **Correct Formula (Exact Match):** `=VLOOKUP(A2,Sheet2!A:C,3,FALSE)`  or `=VLOOKUP(A2,Sheet2!A:C,3,0)`
8.  **Press Enter:** You should now get the correct profession for "Sid" (e.g., "keyboard manager").
9.  **Drag Down the Formula:** To apply the formula to other customer names, you can drag the fill handle (small square at the bottom right of the cell) down.
    *   **Potential Issue:** Dragging down might shift the `table_array` range, causing errors for subsequent lookups.

**Fixing the Table Array Range (Absolute Reference):**

*   **Problem:** When you drag the formula down, the `table_array` range (e.g., `Sheet2!A:C`) shifts relative to the new rows. This can lead to incorrect results or errors as the lookup range moves out of the intended data.
*   **Solution:** Use **absolute references** to "fix" or "lock" the `table_array` range so it doesn't change when you copy the formula down.
*   **How to use absolute references:**
    *   Select the `table_array` range in the formula (e.g., `Sheet2!A:C`).
    *   Press the **F4 key**. This will add dollar signs (`$`) before the column letters and row numbers, making the reference absolute (e.g., `Sheet2!$A$1:$C$100` or `Sheet2!$A:$C` if you selected entire columns).
    *   **Example Formula with Absolute Reference:** `=VLOOKUP(A2,Sheet2!$A:$C,3,FALSE)`
*   **Drag Down Again:** After adding absolute references, drag the formula down. The `table_array` range will remain fixed, and the **VLOOKUP** should work correctly for all customer names.
*   **Double-Click to Fill Down:** Alternatively, double-click the fill handle to automatically copy the formula down to the end of adjacent data in the column to the left.

**Key Rule for VLOOKUP (Exact Match):**

*   The column containing the `lookup_value` (Customer Names in our example) **must be to the left** of the column containing the result you want to return (Profession). This is a fundamental requirement for **VLOOKUP** to function correctly.

**Section 2: VLOOKUP Across Different Sheets**

Let's explore how to use **VLOOKUP** to retrieve data from another sheet within the same **Excel** workbook.

**Example Scenario:**

*   We have a list of **names** on one sheet and want to look up their **phone numbers**.
*   The **phone number** information is located on a *different* sheet called "Data Numbers".

**Data Sets:**

*   **Sheet 1 (Current Sheet):** List of Names (Column A)
*   **Sheet "Data Numbers" (Separate Sheet):** Names, Phone Number, and Profession (Columns A, B, and C respectively)

**Verifying VLOOKUP Compatibility:**

*   **Rule Reminder:**  The `lookup_value` column (Names) must be to the left of the result column (Phone Number) in the "Data Numbers" sheet.
*   **Check:** In the "Data Numbers" sheet, Names *are* indeed to the left of Phone Numbers. Therefore, **VLOOKUP** will work.

**Steps to Use VLOOKUP Across Sheets:**

1.  **Start typing the formula** in the cell where you want the phone number to appear: `=VLOOKUP(`
2.  **`lookup_value`**: Select the cell containing the name you are looking up.
3.  **`table_array`**: Go to the "Data Numbers" sheet by clicking on its sheet tab.
    *   You will see the sheet name appear in the formula bar (e.g., `'Data Numbers'!`).
    *   Select the range on the "Data Numbers" sheet that includes:
        *   The **Name** column (lookup column).
        *   The **Phone Number** column (result column).
        *   *Optional*: You can include other columns in the range if needed, but for this example, just Name and Phone Number are sufficient. You *don't* need to include the "Profession" column if you are only interested in phone numbers.
4.  **Absolute Reference for `table_array`**: Press **F4** to make the `table_array` reference absolute (e.g., `'Data Numbers'!$A:$B`). This is crucial if you plan to drag the formula down.
5.  **`col_index_num`**: Determine the column index number for the **Phone Number** within the selected `table_array` in "Data Numbers".
    *   Column 1: Names
    *   Column 2: Phone Numbers
    *   Enter `2`.
6.  **`range_lookup`**:  For an **exact match** of names, use `FALSE` or `0`.
7.  **Complete Formula (Exact Match, Cross-Sheet Lookup):** `=VLOOKUP(A2,'Data Numbers'!$A:$B,2,FALSE)`
8.  **Press Enter:** You should see the phone number for the looked-up name.
9.  **Fill Down:** Double-click or drag the fill handle to apply the formula to the rest of the names.
10. **Verification:** Double-check a few results by manually comparing with the "Data Numbers" sheet to ensure accuracy.

**Section 3: VLOOKUP for Closest Match (Approximate Match) - Range Lookups**

Now, let's look at using **VLOOKUP** to find the *closest* match, which is typically used with numerical data and ranges.

**Example Scenario:**

*   We have a list of **names** and their **scores**.
*   We want to translate these scores into **grades** based on score ranges.
*   The grade boundaries are defined in a separate table.

**Data Sets:**

*   **Sheet 1 (Current Sheet):** Names and Scores (Columns A and B respectively)
*   **Grade Lookup Table (Same Sheet or Separate Sheet):** Score Lower Bounds and Grades (Columns D and E respectively)

**Grade Lookup Table Structure:**

*   Instead of listing every possible score and grade, the lookup table defines score *ranges* and corresponding grades.
*   The table only specifies the *lower bound* of each score range.
    *   Example:
        *   0: E (Scores 0-54)
        *   55: D (Scores 55-69)
        *   70: C (Scores 70-79)
        *   80: B (Scores 80-89)
        *   90: A (Scores 90+)

**Excel's Interpretation of Range Lookups:**

*   **VLOOKUP** with approximate match (when `range_lookup` is `TRUE` or omitted) looks for the largest value in the first column of the `table_array` that is less than or equal to the `lookup_value`.

**Steps to Use VLOOKUP for Approximate Match (Range Lookup):**

1.  **Start typing the formula:** `=VLOOKUP(`
2.  **`lookup_value`**: Select the cell containing the score you want to look up.
3.  **`table_array`**: Select the range containing the Score Lower Bounds and Grades from the grade lookup table.
4.  **`col_index_num`**: The Grade is in the 2nd column of the `table_array`. Enter `2`.
5.  **`range_lookup`**:  For approximate match, you can:
    *   **Omit the `range_lookup` argument completely.** **VLOOKUP** defaults to approximate match (TRUE) if this argument is left out.
    *   **Explicitly use `TRUE`.** This makes it clearer in the formula that you are performing an approximate match.
6.  **Example Formulas (Approximate Match):**
    *   `=VLOOKUP(B2,D:E,2)` (Omitting `range_lookup` - Default Approximate Match)
    *   `=VLOOKUP(B2,D:E,2,TRUE)` (Explicitly using `TRUE` for Approximate Match)
7.  **Absolute Reference for `table_array`**: Remember to use **F4** to make the `table_array` range absolute (e.g., `$D:$E`) if you plan to drag the formula down.
8.  **Complete Formula (Approximate Match with Absolute Reference):** `=VLOOKUP(B2,$D:$E,2)` or `=VLOOKUP(B2,$D:$E,2,TRUE)`
9.  **Press Enter:** You should get the correct grade based on the score range.
10. **Fill Down:** Drag or double-click to apply to other scores.
11. **Verification:** Check a few results to ensure grades are assigned correctly based on the defined ranges.

**Important Requirement for Approximate Match VLOOKUP:**

*   **Sorted Lookup Column:** When using **VLOOKUP** with approximate match (`TRUE` or omitted `range_lookup`), the *first column* of your `table_array` (the column containing the lookup values - in this case, Score Lower Bounds) **must be sorted in ascending order**. If it's not sorted, **VLOOKUP** might return incorrect or unpredictable results.

**Section 4: Common VLOOKUP Errors and Troubleshooting**

Let's examine some typical errors you might encounter when using **VLOOKUP** and how to fix them. This section also serves as a test of your understanding from the previous parts.

**Error 1: Incorrect Results for Exact Match - Missing `FALSE` or `0`**

**Scenario:**

*   Looking up **Customer Names** based on **Customer IDs**.
*   Using **VLOOKUP** but getting incorrect names for certain IDs.
*   Example: Customer ID "US4556" should return "Blend" but is returning "Silvrr".

**Cause:**

*   Forgetting to specify `FALSE` or `0` as the last argument (`range_lookup`) when you need an **exact match**.
*   When `range_lookup` is omitted, **VLOOKUP** defaults to approximate match, which is not suitable for exact ID lookups.

**Solution:**

*   **Edit the VLOOKUP formula** and add `FALSE` or `0` as the last argument.
*   **Corrected Formula:** `=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, FALSE)` or `=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, 0)`

**Interesting Observation - Approximate Match and Sorted Data:**

*   If you *leave out* the `FALSE` argument (using approximate match by default) and your lookup column in the `table_array` is **sorted in ascending order**, **VLOOKUP** *might* appear to work correctly in some cases.
*   **However, this is not reliable and is strongly discouraged for exact match scenarios.**
*   **Why it can be misleading:** If the data is sorted, approximate match *might* find the closest value that happens to be correct in some instances, but it's not guaranteed, especially if the exact value is not found.
*   **Example of the problem with approximate match for exact lookups:** If you're looking for an ID that *doesn't exist* in the lookup table, approximate match will still return a "closest" match, which is incorrect for exact ID lookups.

**Recommendation:** *Always* use `FALSE` or `0` for the `range_lookup` argument when you require an **exact match**.

**Error 2: Extra Spaces Causing No Match**

**Scenario:**

*   **VLOOKUP** is returning `#N/A` (Value Not Available) even though you believe the `lookup_value` *should* be present in the `table_array`.
*   Example: Looking up a Customer Name by ID, but getting `#N/A` for some IDs.

**Cause:**

*   **Trailing or leading spaces** in either the `lookup_value` or in the values within the lookup column of the `table_array`.
*   Even invisible spaces can cause **VLOOKUP** to fail to find an exact match.

**Solution:**

*   Use the **`TRIM` function** to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the `lookup_value` *within* the **VLOOKUP** formula.
*   **`TRIM` Function:**  `TRIM(text)` - Removes extra spaces from text, leaving only single spaces between words.
*   **Applying TRIM in VLOOKUP:**
    *   Wrap the `lookup_value` part of your **VLOOKUP** formula within the `TRIM` function.
    *   **Example Formula with TRIM:** `=VLOOKUP(TRIM(B4),table_array,col_index_num,FALSE)` (Assuming the lookup value is in cell B4)

**Error 3: `#N/A` Error - Lookup Column on the Wrong Side**

**Scenario:**

*   **VLOOKUP** returning `#N/A` error.
*   You are trying to look up a **Customer ID** and return a **Customer Name**.
*   You've set `range_lookup` to `FALSE` for exact match.

**Cause:**

*   The fundamental **VLOOKUP rule violation**: The column containing the `lookup_value` (Customer ID) must be to the *left* of the column containing the value you want to return (Customer Name) in your `table_array`.
*   If the `lookup_value` column is to the *right* of the result column, **VLOOKUP** will not work.

**Solution:**

*   **Rearrange your `table_array`**: Ensure that the column containing the `lookup_value` is to the left of the column you want to retrieve.
*   **Adjust the `table_array` range** in your **VLOOKUP** formula to reflect the correct column order.
*   **Update `col_index_num`**:  Make sure the `col_index_num` now correctly points to the column containing the desired result within the *rearranged* `table_array`.

**Alternative for Flexible Lookups (Excel for Office 365 and later):**

*   **XLOOKUP Function:** If you are using a newer version of **Excel** (Office 365 or later), consider using the **`XLOOKUP` function**.
*   **`XLOOKUP` Advantages:**
    *   More flexible than **VLOOKUP**.
    *   Does *not* have the restriction that the lookup column must be to the left of the result column.
    *   Generally easier to use and more powerful.

**Error 4: Handling `#N/A` Errors Gracefully - `IFNA` and `IFERROR`**

**Scenario:**

*   **VLOOKUP** returns `#N/A` when a `lookup_value` is not found in the `table_array`.
*   You want to display a more user-friendly message instead of `#N/A` (e.g., "Not found").

**Solution:**

*   Use the **`IFNA` function** or the more general **`IFERROR` function** to handle `#N/A` errors and display a custom message.
*   **`IFNA` Function:** `IFNA(value, value_if_na)` - Returns `value_if_na` if `value` evaluates to `#N/A`; otherwise, returns `value`.
*   **`IFERROR` Function:** `IFERROR(value, value_if_error)` - Returns `value_if_error` if `value` evaluates to *any* error (`#N/A`, `#VALUE!`, `#REF!`, etc.); otherwise, returns `value`.
*   **Applying `IFNA` to VLOOKUP:**
    *   Wrap your **VLOOKUP** formula inside the `IFNA` function.
    *   **Example Formula with IFNA:** `=IFNA(VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, FALSE), "Not found")`
*   **Applying `IFERROR` to VLOOKUP:**
    *   Wrap your **VLOOKUP** formula inside the `IFERROR` function.
    *   **Example Formula with IFERROR:** `=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, FALSE), "Not found")`

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mkfF1pNw0U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mkfF1pNw0U)

**Introduction**

Hi there, Leila here. In this video, I'm addressing a very common question I receive: **"How do I delete blank rows in my dataset?"**

Now, you might already know the manual way: select an entire blank row, right-mouse click, and then **Delete**. However, doing this manually is inefficient, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Therefore, in this video, I will demonstrate **three different methods** to efficiently delete blank rows. My personal favorite is the third method. I'm curious to know your favorite method as well, so please comment below this video and let me know!

**Method 1: Fast Deletion using "Go To Special"**

This first method is incredibly fast, typically taking **under 20 seconds**.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify your identifier column.**
    *   An **identifier column** is a column where a blank cell signifies that the entire row should be deleted.
    *   **Example:** In this dataset, the **"Date" column** is the identifier. If the "Date" cell in a row is blank, we want to delete the entire row. However, if other cells in the row are blank (e.g., in the "Location" or "Campaign Name" columns), we do not want to delete the row.

2.  **Select the entire identifier column.**
    *   Click on the column header (e.g., "Date").
    *   Navigate to the bottom of your dataset.
    *   Use the shortcut keys: **Ctrl + Shift + Home** to select from the bottom back up to the top of the column.

3.  **Open "Go To Special" dialog.**
    *   Navigate to **Home** tab in the ribbon.
    *   Click on **Find & Select** in the **Editing** group.
    *   Choose **Go To Special...**

4.  **Select "Blanks" in "Go To Special".**
    *   In the **Go To Special** dialog box, select **Blanks**.
    *   Click **OK**. This will select all blank cells within your selected identifier column.

5.  **Delete Sheet Rows.**
    *   **Important:** Do not click anywhere on the worksheet after clicking "OK" in the "Go To Special" dialog.
    *   Go directly to the **Home** tab in the ribbon.
    *   In the **Cells** group, click on **Delete**.
    *   Choose **Delete Sheet Rows...**. This will delete all rows where a blank cell was selected in your identifier column.

**Faster Version using Shortcut Keys:**

You can expedite this method even further by using shortcut keys:

1.  **Select your identifier column(s)** (as described in Step 2 above).
2.  Press **Ctrl + G** to open the **Go To** dialog box.
3.  Press **Alt + S** to open the **Go To Special** dialog box.
4.  Press **K** to select **Blanks**.
5.  Press **Enter** to confirm and select the blank cells.
6.  Press **Ctrl + -** (minus sign) to open the **Delete** dialog box.
7.  Press the **down arrow key** to select **Entire row**.
8.  Press **Enter** to confirm and delete the entire rows.

**Method 2: Filter Method with Helper Column**

This method is useful when you **don't have a clear identifier column** or when you need to ensure that **every single cell in a row is empty** before deleting it.

**Scenario:**

Let's say sometimes the "Date" might be empty, but you still want to keep the row.  You also cannot rely on any single column as an identifier because other columns like "Location" or "Campaign Name" might also be empty in valid rows. In this case, you want to delete rows only when *all* cells in the row are blank.

**Steps:**

1.  **Insert a Helper Column.**
    *   Insert a new column to the right of your data.
    *   In the header cell of this new column (e.g., in cell H1 if your data ends at column G), type a heading like **"Check"**.

2.  **Use the COUNTA function in the Helper Column.**
    *   In the first data row of the "Check" column (e.g., cell H2), enter the formula: **`=COUNTA(A2:G2)`** (adjust the range `A2:G2` to cover all columns in your data range for the first row).
    *   The **COUNTA function** counts the number of cells in a range that are *not* empty (containing numbers or text).
    *   Press **Enter**. The cell will display the count of non-empty cells in that row.

3.  **Copy the COUNTA formula down.**
    *   Click on the fill handle (the small square at the bottom right corner of the cell containing the formula, H2 in our example).
    *   Drag the fill handle down to the last row of your dataset to copy the formula to all rows.
    *   For blank rows, the "Check" column will display **0** because COUNTA will find no non-empty cells.

4.  **Activate Filter.**
    *   Select any cell within your data range, including the header row.
    *   Press **Ctrl + Shift + L** to activate the filter.
    *   Alternatively, go to the **Data** tab in the ribbon and click on **Filter** in the **Sort & Filter** group. Filter dropdown arrows will appear in the header row of each column.

5.  **Filter for Zeros in the Helper Column.**
    *   Click on the filter dropdown arrow in the "Check" column header.
    *   Uncheck **(Select All)** to deselect all values.
    *   Place a checkmark next to **0** to filter and display only rows where the "Check" column value is zero (i.e., blank rows).
    *   Click **OK**. Only the blank rows (identified by a 0 in the "Check" column) will now be visible.

6.  **Delete the Filtered Rows.**
    *   Select all the visible rows (which are the blank rows). You can click on the row number of the first visible row, then press **Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow** to select all consecutive visible rows.
    *   Delete the selected rows using any of these methods:
        *   **Home** tab → **Delete** → **Delete Sheet Rows**
        *   **Right-mouse click** on any of the selected row numbers → **Delete**
        *   Shortcut key: **Ctrl + -** (minus sign) → choose **Entire row** → **Enter**

7.  **Remove the Filter.**
    *   Press **Ctrl + Shift + L** again to deactivate the filter. This will make all rows visible again.  Only the blank rows (which were filtered and then deleted) will be gone.

8.  **Delete the Helper Column.**
    *   Select the entire "Check" column (e.g., column H).
    *   Right-mouse click on the column header (e.g., "H").
    *   Select **Delete** to remove the helper column.

**Method 3: Power Query Method (Dynamic and Preferred Method)**

This is Leila's favorite method due to its **dynamic nature** and **speed**. It is especially useful when you anticipate **future data updates**.

**Steps:**

1.  **Prepare for Dynamic Range (Optional but Recommended).**
    *   Go to the bottom of your dataset.
    *   Add some blank rows below your existing data to account for potential future data additions (e.g., go down to row 200). This ensures the Power Query range can accommodate new data.

2.  **Select the Data Range.**
    *   Select your entire dataset, including the blank rows you added in step 1.
    *   Use shortcut keys: **Ctrl + Shift + Home** to select from the current cell back up to the beginning of your data range.

3.  **Name the Range (Crucial for Avoiding Table Conversion).**
    *   Go to the **Name Box** (located to the left of the formula bar, usually displaying the current cell address).
    *   Type a name for your selected range, such as **"MyRange"** (or any name without spaces).
    *   Press **Enter** to define this named range.
    *   **Important:** Naming the range *before* using "From Table/Range" prevents Excel from automatically converting your source data into an Excel Table, which might not be desired in all cases.

4.  **Load Data into Power Query.**
    *   Go to the **Data** tab in the ribbon.
    *   In the **Get & Transform Data** group, click on **From Table/Range**.
    *   Because you named the range "MyRange", Power Query will recognize it and load it without converting your source data into a table in Excel.

5.  **Remove Blank Rows in Power Query.**
    *   In the Power Query Editor window, navigate to the **Home** tab.
    *   In the **Reduce Rows** group, click on **Remove Rows**.
    *   Select **Remove Blank Rows**. Power Query will automatically detect and remove rows that are entirely blank.

6.  **Load Clean Data Back to Excel.**
    *   In the Power Query Editor, go to the **Home** tab.
    *   In the **Close** group, click on the dropdown arrow next to **Close & Load**.
    *   Select **Close & Load To...** (or simply **Close & Load** to load to a new sheet as a table).
    *   In the **Import Data** dialog box, you can choose where to load the data:
        *   **Table** (default, loads data as an Excel table on a new sheet or existing sheet)
        *   **PivotTable Report** (loads data for creating a PivotTable)
        *   **PivotChart**
        *   **Only Create Connection**
    *   Choose your desired option (e.g., **Table** to load the cleaned data as a table on a new sheet).
    *   Click **OK**. Power Query will process the data and load the cleaned data (without blank rows) into Excel.

7.  **Customize Table Appearance (Optional).**
    *   If you loaded the data as a table and want to adjust its appearance:
        *   Select any cell within the loaded table.
        *   Go to the **Table Design** tab in the ribbon (appears when a table is selected).
        *   In the **Table Styles** group, you can choose a different style or clear the style altogether by selecting **None** in the style gallery.
        *   To make headers bold, select the header row and press **Ctrl + B** or click the **Bold** button in the **Home** tab, **Font** group.

**Dynamic Refresh for New Data:**

The Power Query method is dynamic. If you add new data to your original "MyRange" (including adding data in the blank rows you prepared earlier), you can easily refresh the Power Query output to include the new data and remove any new blank rows.

**Steps to Refresh:**

1.  Add new data to your original data range ("MyRange"). You can add data at the bottom, and even add new blank rows within or at the end of the data.
2.  Go to the sheet where the Power Query output table is located (e.g., the sheet might be named "Sheet2" by default or you might have renamed it).
3.  Right-mouse click anywhere within the Power Query output table.
4.  Select **Refresh** from the context menu. Power Query will re-run the query, fetch the updated data from "MyRange", remove blank rows again, and update the output table with the new, cleaned data.

**Removing the Connection to Source Data (Making it Standalone):**

If you want to break the dynamic link between the Power Query output and the original "MyRange" data, and just have the cleaned data as static data in Excel:

1.  Go to the **Data** tab in the ribbon.
2.  In the **Get & Transform Data** group, click on **Queries & Connections**. This opens the **Queries & Connections** pane on the right side of the Excel window.
3.  In the **Queries & Connections** pane, locate your query (it might be named after your named range, e.g., "Query - MyRange").
4.  Right-mouse click on the query name.
5.  Select **Delete** from the context menu.
6.  Excel will ask for confirmation: "Deleting this query will remove it from the workbook. The loaded data will remain in the worksheet but will no longer be refreshed. Do you want to continue?"
7.  Click **Delete** to confirm. The query connection will be removed, and your data in the worksheet will become static, no longer linked to the original "MyRange" or refreshable.

**Loading to a Pivot Table Report:**

Power Query allows flexibility in how you consume the cleaned data. You can load it directly to a Pivot Table for analysis:

1.  In the **Queries & Connections** pane, right-mouse click on your query.
2.  Select **Load To...** from the context menu.
3.  In the **Import Data** dialog box, choose **PivotTable Report**.
4.  Select where you want to place the PivotTable (e.g., **New worksheet** or **Existing worksheet**).
5.  Click **OK**. Excel might warn you that placing a PivotTable might overwrite existing data if you choose an existing worksheet location. Confirm with **OK**. Excel will create a PivotTable layout connected to your cleaned data from Power Query, ready for you to build your PivotTable reports.

**Conclusion and Call to Action**

So, those are three methods for deleting blank rows in Excel! I personally love **Power Query** because it is so powerful and dynamic.

I'm really curious to know which method you prefer. Please **comment below** and let me know your favorite method!

**Power Query Analogy:**

If Power Query were a food type—and I'm currently quite focused on food due to my muscle-building training plan—I'd say Power Query is like one of those **highly nutritious foods** that you should consume every day for good health. With just a little bit of Power Query knowledge, you can achieve so much and unlock many opportunities you might have missed before.

**Learn More about Power Query and Pivot Tables:**

If you are interested in learning Power Query, we offer a **Power Query course** that takes you from beginner to ninja level.  However, even just mastering the beginner sections of Power Query can significantly enhance your data handling skills.

We also recently released a new course called **Pivot Table Essentials** if you want to explore the power of Pivot Tables for data analysis.

Check out these courses if you're interested in learning more!

Thank you for being here and watching all the way to the end. I'll catch you in the next video.
