## What is Arc 2.0?
Arc 2.0 Browser is a skin made for Zen Browser that adds lots of polish to the design by incorporating animations, blurs and more. It's pretty much the skin I personally use, but made public because people wanted the CSS. This skin is inspired by Arc browser and some other Zen skins (listed in credits)

Arc 2.0 is NOT a standalone browser. I don't even intend on making one.

Arc 2.0 has been tested on 1.8.2b (Beta) on Windows. Note: It is not tested on Mac.

### features are listed below!
### ℹ️ Note

> Please remember that Arc 2.0 in the end is my personal browser skin. If you don't like a design choice I've
> made, chances are I'll keep it if I still like it. So please be respectful and refrain from attacking people when you
> make suggestions. Thanks!

## How to use? (Full video tutorial given below)
Install the ZIP file from Releases. Extract it. Copy and paste the files inside the ZIP file in the chrome folder.

After installing the css files, open the browser and pin the Copy Frame or Page URL extension (extensions listed below).

Now install the mods and other extensions listed below and then alter the settings as listed below or according to yourself.

Enable the required Configs from ```about:config```

Adjust or change the different toolbar items according to the one I made like arc (in the image) or according to yourself).

Vallah! You got yourself a new browser which is arc but a lot more better!!!

This is what your chrome folder should look like:
