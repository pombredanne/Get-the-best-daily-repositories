## Running Locally

- Add local audio files to a top level `tracks/` folder (git ignored)
- Go to http://localhost:3000/p/1

## Features

- Blazing fast
- Did I mention it's blazing fast?
- vim motions (lol) â€“ move between songs with [J]/[K]
- Double click on song to play (can you believe it?)
- Nice animation for currently playing song

## TODO

- Create playlists
- Save playlist information
- Persist active song to storage
- Allow a version to be played online with fixed songs?
- Hook up search (playlists or songs? Not sure)
- Add/remove songs to playlists
- View for all tracks
- Hook up the volume control
- Ability to drag on the progress bar to seek song
