100% UNOFFICIAL COMMUNITY EFFORT.

## How does it work?

The FeliCa NFC Card stores the last 10 transactions performed by your card. That part of the 
memory is readable through NFC commands. Thus, the system does not require any API connectivity
to servers. However, only limited to 10 transactions. 

To get anything more than this, you'd need DMTCL to build something official.
