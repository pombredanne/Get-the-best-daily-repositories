The company size of our customers also grew\u2014some of them run their global HR and payroll for thousands of workers fully through Deel.\nTo be able to provide an elevated, one-of-a-kind experience to all our customers, big or small, we needed to keep tabs on the efficiency of our processes\u2014all the time.\nThat\u2019s how Deel AI was born.\nBuilt for internal use, fine-tuned for everyone\nWhen you\u2019re such a big, global team, and especially in the field of global HR, payroll, and compliance, there\u2019s no room for mistakes. Every error can turn out to be costly.\nThat\u2019s why we do everything to ensure the accuracy of the information we work with. But, managing an enormous\nknowledge base for the 150+ countries\nwe help customers hire in can be difficult.\nWe faced similar challenges when we needed\nan effective HRIS that could scale with us\nand support our needs as a global company. We couldn\u2019t find an ideal tool among the existing platforms, so we built one.\nNow, we wanted to reduce the time necessary to find the right answers around global hiring and within our own organization, removing the back-and-forth among multiple team members.\nHere\u2019s how Deel AI\u00a0makes it easier for us:\nWe get answers fast:\nInstead of manually browsing through our internal data, we rely on carefully trained AI to surface the right information quickly. That helps us resolve issues and queries for our customers faster than ever.\nWe have one source of truth:\nWe\u2019ve said goodbye to mismatching data in different resources. Thanks to Deel AI, we know we\u2019re working with accurate and up-to-date data at all times.\nWe keep the data accessible:\nOur internal wiki keeps the data digestible for everyone on our team, even the team members who don\u2019t have legal expertise. This facilitates many processes within the organization, from communication with customers to creating marketing materials, as it removes the need for back-and-forth messages between team members.\nOnce we realized we\u2019d built a powerful knowledge base for internal use, we started thinking about how our customers could benefit from it as well.\nFor HR professionals looking to take this leap into the world of AI, the landscape will undoubtedly be messy for a while - but Deel is aiming to make it clearer.\n\u2014\nAlex Bouaziz\n,\nCEO & Co-founder, Deel\nHow does Deel AI\u00a0actually work?\nDeel AI\u00a0is like a global employment assistant who has all the answers about laws and regulations in over 150 countries, but can also give you instant insights and reports on your workforce data. It\u2019s built based on the same AI-powered language model that\u2019s behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, with additional access to Deel's deep knowledge base to make sure our experts\u2019 factual knowledge is included, too.\nWe rely on an internal team of 20+ engineers and writers to build the product and cover global compliance and payroll topics by getting the data from our local experts, and helping all other team members get answers quickly when they need them.\nWhen talking to our customers or prospects, their questions may sometimes get very specific. Like:\nWhat type of worker can I hire in Brazil?\nHow long is maternity leave in Spain?\nHow do you terminate full-time employees in the Philippines?\nWhat's the median salary for a Sr. Data Analyst in Canada?\nOr even: How many new workers started this month?\nWhether our team members are writing a blog post, resolving a support ticket, or having a sales call, they can quickly enter these questions into Deel AI\u00a0and provide an explanation to the customer. No more \u201cwe\u2019ll get back to you with this later\u201d and having to memorize pages and pages of documentation for each of the 150 countries.\nWe always strive to make our products flawless, so our team members are frequently asked to provide honest feedback on Deel AI\u2019s performance. That way, we can work day and night to make sure the product is up to the standards we aim to maintain. We know that human involvement is irreplaceable to ensure the maximum accuracy of all information provided, so our in-house experts validate every single query entered into the system.\nIn addition to continuously training and improving our models, anytime we have questions not in our knowledge base, we have a 24-hour SLA to create the content with our team of over 40 compliance experts, making sure we have the most up-to-date and accurate answers possible. On the infrastructure side, we also built some powerful technology to ensure our clients' data is protected while still available through generative AI.\n\u2014\nAaron Goldsmid\n,\nHead of Product, Payments & Integration, Deel\nOur knowledge is at your disposal\nDeel AI\u00a0demonstrates our dedication not only to providing an unrivaled customer experience but also to keeping up with the trends and leveraging technological advancements to improve our product further.\nWhat impresses me the most about Deel AI is the reactions that we get from our customers.  It enables them to have access to the world's foremost knowledge base and employment data at their fingertips in an incredibly intuitive experience. It empowers them with knowledge and gives them time back.\n\u2014\nAaron Goldsmid\n,\nHead of Product, Payments & Integration, Deel\nWe don\u2019t want to compromise when it comes to facilitating global employment and helping our customers build the business of their dreams.
