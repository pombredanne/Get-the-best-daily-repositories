It is the 6th most-followed brand on Instagram worldwide and has a total audience of 150 million people. As one of the top 300 global websites, 9GAG is constantly being updated with thousands of new user-generated media on a daily basis.\nInformation\nUse Case\nContent moderation\nIndustry\nMedia and entertainment\nClient\n9GAG\nDetails\nChallenge\nCo-Founder and VP of Product, Chris Chan, knew that moderation was a foundation of a successful community. Although most people shared interesting and funny posts on 9GAG, some would try to post spam, inappropriate, or sexually explicit content. In order to protect users, the team of four moderators would manually review every post that was uploaded to the platform; a task which Chris admits was \u201ca routine and often unpleasant job.\u201d\nHowever, the platform was experiencing exponential growth and the sheer volume of content to be reviewed was becoming unmanageable. Chris and the team were keen to find a way to automate community moderation and thought that AI might provide them with a scalable, efficient solution that would support them as they continued to grow.\nSolution\nThe 9GAG team searched Hacker News and asked their network to recommend computer vision and AI solution platform providers. They created a shortlist and proceeded to compare and test the tools offered by these providers. During the testing phase, it became clear that Clarifai offered the best\ncontent moderation solution\n. Chris was particularly impressed by Clarifai\u2019s ability to separate\nNSFW\n\u201cexplicit nudity\u201d from \u201csuggestive nudity\u201d with a level of accuracy unmatched by Amazon and Google.\nResults\nThanks to Clarifai's\npre-trained moderation models\n, it took one developer just four weeks to integrate AI to the 9GAG content moderation process (a feat which Chris says \u201cis pretty impressive\u201d). Now, Clarifai\u2019s intelligent\nmoderation model\nchecks over 20,000 pieces of user-generated content on 9GAG for gore, drugs, explicit, and suggestive nudity every day at a level of 95% accuracy compared to human review.\nSince implementing Clarifai's computer vision platform, 9GAG has reduced the hours spent moderating the platform for inappropriate content by over 90%. This has enabled the team to reinvest time in more impactful work, such as supporting the growing community.\n90%\nReduction in moderation hours; saving 145 hours per week\n95%\nImprovement in accurately detecting unwanted content\n20K\nUser generated images moderated daily\nWe compared several services including Google Cloud Vision, Amazon and Clarifai.
