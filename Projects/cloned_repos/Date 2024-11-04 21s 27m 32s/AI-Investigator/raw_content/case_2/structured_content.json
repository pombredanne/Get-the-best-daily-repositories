They offer a look into what a dining experience is like at user reviewed restaurants. They expect all of the content to be relevant and appealing in order to entice future diners to book a reservation. This supports an authentic experience that consumers have come to expect.\nInformation\nUse Case\nContent moderation\nIndustry\nServices\nClient\nRestaurant reservation company\nDetails\nChallenge\nBefore using Clarifai, OpenTable could moderate only 300 images per day because they had one person manually reviewing user generated content. The moderator's job was to make sure there wasn't anything inappropriate in the photos. After reviewing, the images were organized into categories like \"pictures of the restaurant itself,\" \"pictures of the food,\" \"pictures of the wait-staff,\" \"pictures of the guests,\" etc.\nBecause of the sheer volume of images posted, many images could not be reviewed and inappropriate images were inadvertently posted which negatively impacted the company\u2019s reputation and brand. The lack of a scalable content moderation strategy prevented them from pursuing their goal of ingesting photos from Instagram onto their website to increase the amount of user generated reviews.\nSolution\nBefore spending money on hiring additional human moderators, OpenTable turned to Clarifai to leverage the capabilities of its AI lifecycle platform,\ncontent moderation\n, and custom models in order to curate their restaurant photos appropriately. Clarifai helped them build custom trained models with concepts that encompassed all of the types of pictures users could submit from their restaurant experience. After the models were trained, OpenTable was able to plug into a\nClarifai API\n, so their moderation team could use the Clarifai platform to review predictions. OpenTable was able to train its models in about 14 days before using the Clarifai platform for its predictive capabilities.\nResults\n16x improvement of operational efficiency and moderator productivity\nIncreased images moderated from 300 to 5,000 per day per moderator\nMitigated legal concerns over unwanted content and copyright infringements\nReady to get started?\nWhether you're a start-up or a Fortune 500, contact us to discuss how to enrich your data with AI assisted labeling to annotate datasets accurately, quickly and affordably.\nLearn more about Clarifai\nSchedule a demo\nDiscuss your solutions options\nAlready a customer?\nIf you are encountering a technical or payment issue, the customer support team will be happy to assist you.\nContact support >\n\u00a9 2023 Clarifai, Inc.\nTerms of Service\nContent Takedown\nPrivacy Policy\nCONTACT\nsales@clarifai.com\nmarketing@clarifai.com\ngovernment@clarifai.com\nPlatform\nOverview\nAI Lake\nScribe Label\nSpacetime Search\nEnlight Train\nMesh Workflows\nFlare Edge\nUI Modules\nNew\nComputer Vision\nFoundation Models\nGenerative AI\nNLP\nSolutions\nBy Industry\nGovernment\nManufacturing\nMedia and Entertainment\nRetail and E-Commerce\nTransportation\nBy Use Case\nContent Moderation\nDigital Asset Management\nIntelligence, Surveillance\nProduct Discovery\nVisual Inspection\nCommunity\nExplore\nImage Models\nText Models\nAudio Models\nWorkflows\nCOMPANY\nAbout\nCareers\nWe\u2019re hiring!\nCustomers\nEvents\nPartners\nPress\nTech Awards\nResources\nAPI Status\nBlog\nDocs\nResource Library\nDiscord\nYouTube\nPricing\nCONTACT\nsales@clarifai.com\nmarketing@clarifai.com\ngovernment@clarifai.com\n\u00a9 2023 Clarifai, Inc.\nTerms of Service\nContent Takedown\nPrivacy Policy",
