Or\nI'd\nhave to search sites like Dribbble, Mobbin, or one of the many UX pattern repositories out there \u2014 trying to visually parse if something was solving a similar problem to the one I was designing for.\nMagic Patterns bridges knowledge gaps\n, accelerating the learning process and enabling designers of all experience levels to reach better solutions more quickly.\nInnovations such as Magic Patterns and its screenshot-to-code feature is helping us get past the blank page problem. Tools like this are moving designers into the role of curator and design instructor, rather than simply production designer. Sometimes I feel like Magic Patterns is my intern. Definitely helping me move faster in more directions in parallel.\nIt's made my current workflow even faster.\nExisting tools are\n              great for visual design, but when it comes to pattern ideation\n              that's specific to your use case - that's so much harder to find\n              and\nMagic Patterns gets the job done\n.\nSteve Witmer\nDesign Co-Founder\nRoster\nThe future of work for entertainment production and crew\nonroster.io\nFounded\nSan Diego, 2023\nUsing Magic Patterns since\nMay 2024\nFavorite feature\nDesign inspiration\nMagic Patterns\nAll Systems Operational\nOverview\nGet Started\nDocumentation\nPrompting Guide\nProduct\nPricing\nSecurity\nContact Sales\nUse Cases\nProduct\nDesigners\nFounders\nSales\nCompany\nBlog\nCustomers\nCareers\nSocial Media\nLegal\nContact\nAcceptable Use\nTerms\nPrivacy Policy\n\u00a9 North Park Labs 2024",
