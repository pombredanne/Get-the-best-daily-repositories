# Searching crypto wallets
You can run a search for 2 types of crypto wallets with balance. 
To start searching for bitcoin wallets, press key 3 in the menu or run start_search_btc.bat. 
To start searching for EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, etc.), press the 4 key in the menu or run start_search_evm.bat. \
The speed of searching for wallets depends on your hardware, primarily your video card. Also, depending on your hardware, to increase the chance of finding a wallet with a balance, you can run multiple copies of the program, about 1 to 4, or more if you have a powerful video card.

## My Find
I also managed to find 2 Bitcoin wallets with balance. 
the first was with 0.000032 bitcoin and the second was with 0.528 bitcoin (3800$ at the time of finding).
