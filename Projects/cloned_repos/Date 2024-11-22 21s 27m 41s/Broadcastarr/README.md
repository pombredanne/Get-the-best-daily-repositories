# Broadcastarr
Broadcastarr is a service that allows you to broadcast media content retrieved from web pages.

The tasks are:
 - Publish category
Ensures that the active categories are published, and starts indexing the categories for each active indexer.
 - Index category
Indexes the category for each a given indexer, schedules the next indexation and the grabbing of the broadcast stream.
 - Grab broadcast stream
Grabs the broadcast stream for each broadcast in the category, schedules the release of the broadcast.
 - Release broadcast
Releases the broadcast to the active releasers, schedules the publishing of associated group.
 - Publish group
Publishes the group to the active publishers.
 - Update category channel name
Updates the category channel name on the active publishers.
 - Delete broadcast
Deletes the broadcast.

### Discord Bot

### Releaser
A releaser is a service that can read the broadcasts.

### Scalability
The service is designed to be scalable and can be deployed on multiple instances.

### VPN
The docker compose includes a Wireguard client that allows the workers to scrape and grab the broadcasts from the web pages through a VPN.
The used configuration file is ./wg0.conf.

## Installation

First you need to create the env files and fill them with the correct values.
```
cp .env.default .env
cp .env.init.default .env.init
```

Then you need to initialize the database and shut it down.
```
docker compose up init
docker compose down init
```

Finally you can start the service.
```
docker compose up -d server worker
```

Additionally you can have multiple workers in the compose file to handle more tasks at the same time.

## Configuration

### Initialization
In the .env.init file:
 - Set the different delay values (in second).
 - Set the limit values (in minutes).
 - Set the Categories to create with their respective emoji.
```.env
CATEGORIES_EMOJI=Football:‚öΩ,Basketball:üèÄ
```
 - Set the groups to create with their respective category and country.
```.env
GROUPS="Football:France*Ligue 1,Spain*La Liga|Basketball:USA*NBA"
```
 - Set the discord webhookks to activate.
```.env
DISCORD_WEBHOOKS="Football:id:token,Rugby:id:token"
```

 - Set the publishers to activate.

```.env
CREATE_PUBLISHER_DISCORD=true
CREATE_PUBLISHER_MATRIX=false
```

  - Set the releasers to activate.
  
```.env
CREATE_RELEASER_JELLYFIN=true
```

Add the definitions of the indexers as json files in the ./src/init/data
```typescript
type Replacement = {
  regex: RegExp;
  replace: string;
}

type DateReplacement = {
  regex: RegExp;
  format: string;
}

type Selector = {
  path: string;
}

type TextContentSelector = Selector & {
  attribute?: string;
  replacement?: Replacement;
}

type DateSelector = TextContentSelector & {
  format?: string;
  dateReplacement?: DateReplacement;
}

type RegexSelector<T extends Record<string, string>> = TextContentSelector & {
  regex: RegExp;
  default?: T;
}
```
```jsonc

      "group": RegexSelector[],
    },
    // The selectors to retrieve the next page link, as long as there is a next page, and the broadcastSets start before the future limit, we go to the next page and continue the indexation
    "nextPage": Selector[],

  // The data to configure the grabbing
  "interceptorData": {
    // Element to wait before looking for stream items

    // The selectors to retrieve the score of the broadcast, is run in the context of the stream item
    "positiveScores": Selector[],
    // The selectors to retrieve the link of the broadcast, is run in the context of the stream item
    "link": TextContentSelector[],
    // If set, we go to the link(s) previously found with a referer header
    "referer": string,
    // If set, we click on the items found (play button for instance)
