// For the most part, this is a cache, of the various requests we have
// received and rate limited, so that when a new request comes in we can
// know right away that it should be rejected.
//
// But in addition to saving some effort, it also provides stability,
// because any given request could potentially match various filters
// with different limits. So this ensures that when we give a limit
// in a rate limiting error we stick to it until it falls out of force.
