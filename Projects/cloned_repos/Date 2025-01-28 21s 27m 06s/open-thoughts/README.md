  <i>Curating the best open reasoning datasets</i><br> 
  A collaboration led by <a href="https://bespokelabs.ai/">Bespoke Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.datacomp.ai/">DataComp</a> community

</p>
<hr>

Our first goal is to curate a reasoning dataset to train state-of-the-art small reasoning models that surpass [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) and [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) on math and code reasoning benchmarks.

# Installation
```
make install
poetry shell
```
Set the DeepSeek API key:
```
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Set HF_ORG to your organization id. Set HF_PRIVATE=true if you want to push to a private repo.
```
export HF_ORG=your_org_id
export HF_PRIVATE=false
```

# Data Generation

Currently, we are generating data for the following domains:
1. Code
2. Math
3. Science
4. Puzzle

The recipe is outlined below:
