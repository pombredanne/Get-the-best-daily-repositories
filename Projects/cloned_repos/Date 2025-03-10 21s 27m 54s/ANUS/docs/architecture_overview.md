```

1. The user submits a task or query through the User Interface.
2. The User Interface forwards the request to the Core Engine.
3. The Core Engine analyzes the task and activates the appropriate Agent System components.
4. The Agent System processes the task, using the Model Integration layer for reasoning and decision-making.
5. The Agent System uses the Tool Ecosystem to interact with external systems as needed.
6. Results flow back through the system to the User Interface, which presents them to the user.
