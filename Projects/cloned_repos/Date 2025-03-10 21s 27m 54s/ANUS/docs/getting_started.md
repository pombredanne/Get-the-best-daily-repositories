# Getting Started with Anus AI

This guide will help you get started with using the Anus AI framework for your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Installation

### Quick Installation

The easiest way to install Anus AI is via pip:

```bash
pip install anus-ai
```

### Development Installation

If you want to contribute to Anus AI or use the latest development version:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anus-ai/anus.git
cd anus

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

After installation, you'll need to configure Anus AI with your API keys:

1. Create a configuration file:

```bash
anus init
```

2. Edit the generated `.anus/config.yaml` file with your API keys:

```yaml
llm:
  provider: openai
  api_key: your_openai_api_key
  model: gpt-4o

# Optional: Configure other providers
anthropic:
  api_key: your_anthropic_api_key
```

## Your First Anus AI Project

### Simple Question Answering

Create a file named `simple_question.py`:

```python
from anus import Agent

# Create a single agent
agent = Agent()

# Ask a simple question
response = agent.run("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)
```

Run the script:

```bash
python simple_question.py
```

### Web Search Example

Create a file named `web_search.py`:

```python
from anus import Agent
from anus.tools import SearchTool

# Create an agent with search capabilities
agent = Agent(tools=[SearchTool()])

# Search for information
response = agent.run("Find the latest research on quantum computing")
print(response)
```

Run the script:

```bash
python web_search.py
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Create a file named `multi_agent.py`:

```python
from anus import Society, Agent

# Create specialized agents
researcher = Agent(role="researcher")
analyst = Agent(role="analyst")
writer = Agent(role="writer")

# Create a society of agents
society = Society(agents=[researcher, analyst, writer])

# Execute a complex task with collaboration
response = society.run(
    "Research the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, " 
    "analyze the findings, and write a comprehensive report"
)
print(response)
```

Run the script:

```bash
python multi_agent.py
```

## Using the Command-Line Interface

Anus AI comes with a powerful command-line interface:

```bash
# Run a simple task
anus run "What is the population of Tokyo?"

# Run in interactive mode
anus interactive

# Run with a specific configuration file
anus run --config custom_config.yaml "Summarize this article: https://example.com/article"
```
