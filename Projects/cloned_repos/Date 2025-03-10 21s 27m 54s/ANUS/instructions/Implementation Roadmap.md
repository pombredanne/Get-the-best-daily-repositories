## Implementation Priorities

1. **Core Agent System**: The foundation of ANUS, enabling basic task execution
2. **Tool Integration**: Essential for agent capabilities and task execution
3. **Planning System**: Critical for breaking down complex tasks
4. **Memory System**: Important for context retention and learning
5. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Key differentiator for ANUS
6. **User Interfaces**: Necessary for usability and adoption

## Key Technical Challenges

1. **Hybrid Agent Implementation**: Balancing single-agent simplicity with multi-agent power
2. **Resource Optimization**: Efficiently allocating computational resources
3. **Tool Security**: Ensuring safe execution of tools, especially code execution
4. **Model Integration**: Supporting multiple model providers with consistent interface
5. **Memory Management**: Balancing context retention with performance

## Integration Strategy

The integration strategy focuses on adapting OpenManus concepts while maintaining ANUS's unique identity:

1. **Preserve Directory Structure**: Maintain ANUS's existing directory layout
2. **Adapt Core Classes**: Reinterpret OpenManus classes to fit ANUS architecture
3. **Enhance with New Features**: Add ANUS-specific features not present in OpenManus
4. **Maintain Consistent Style**: Ensure code style and patterns are consistent
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build core functionality first, then add advanced features

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual components and classes
2. **Integration Tests**: For interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: For complete task execution flows
4. **Performance Tests**: For resource usage and optimization
5. **User Experience Tests**: For interface usability

## Documentation Plan

1. **API Reference**: Comprehensive documentation of all classes and methods
2. **Architecture Guide**: Overview of system design and components
3. **User Guide**: Instructions for using ANUS
