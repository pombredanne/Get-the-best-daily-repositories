## Foreword

India is one of the major countries which witness natural and human induced disasters very frequently. Floods, droughts, cyclones, and earthquakes  cause  severe  loss  to  human  lives  and  physical  resources. Communal riots, conflicts, fires,  epidemics,  accidents  and other  disasters compound  the  country's  chronic  troubles.    The  social  and  economic progress  achieved  over  decades  by  the  people,  and  advances  in  physical development,  can  be  significantly  devastated  and  degraded  by  disasters. The Government of India and State Governments through various agencies have been making efforts to meet the exigencies as arisen by natural and man made disasters.  It is, however, experienced that all these efforts and contingency  plans  concentrate  on  the  post  disaster  situation.  Thus  it  is imperative  to  prevent  and  mitigate  the  disasters,  and  also  prepare  the community and other stakeholders for disaster response, rehabilitation and reconstruction of disasters affected victims and areas.

The Handbook on Disaster Management highlights various dimensions, approaches and issues pertaining to disasters management. It is  hoped that the Handbook will be use of immense in understanding the dynamics of disaster management in the country.

We received suggestions from various individuals and organizations on this volume. We are thankful to all of them. Our special thanks are due to the Principal Secretary to the Government of U.P. in the Deptt. of Urban Development and Director of Urban Local Bodies for their support in the endeavor.

## Preface

India is one of the most disasters prone countries of the world. About 60 percent  of  the  landmass  is  reported  to  be  susceptible  to  seismic  activity  and about 18 percent country's total area is drought prone. About 40 million hectares of land in the country has been identified as flood prone. The Indian Ocean is one of the six major cyclone prone reasons of the globe. Among the 32 states and union territories in the country, 22 are multi disasters prone.

Increasing urbanization, expansion of habitats into unsuitable vulnerable areas, higher population density, higher housing density, vulnerable housing and buildings constructions  and non-engineered  unsafe  construction  and  aging buildings  and  other  infrastructures  are  some  of  the  factors  that  have  increased vulnerability  of  hazards  and  disasters  in  urban  areas.  The  poor  planning  of drainage  and  defunct  drainage  system  in  some  of  the  major  cities  have  also caused pro-longed water logging and urban floods. The natural disasters such as floods, droughts, cyclone, earthquakes etc. that adversely affect the agricultural income also result in migration of people from rural areas to urban centers. This may put immense pressure on civic services and infrastructure. The man made disasters such as accidents, epidemics, communal violence etc are more prone to urban centers.

Disasters  can  not  be  predicted,  however  the  loss  of  disasters  may  be reduced significantly through proper planning, mitigation measures, preparedness and effective management system. Thus, it is imperative to develop perspective planning for the prevention, disaster response and rehabilitation and reconstruction  of  disaster's  affected  victims  and  areas.  Present  Handbook  on Disaster  Management  highlights  emerging  perspective  of  different  types  of disasters and their effective management. I hope that the volume will be highly useful to those who are interested in this field.

## CHAPTER-I INTRODUCTION

India is one of the world's major theaters of disasters-both natural and human made.  Floods, droughts, cyclones, and earthquakes pound it end to end  every  year.    Communal  riots,  conflicts,  fires,  epidemics,  and  other disasters compound the country's chronic troubles.  The social and economic progress and advances physical development in any country achieved over decades can be significantly devastated and degraded by disasters. Urbanization, industrialization, globalization and liberalization of economy all  have  influenced  human  life.    People  are  tend  to  live  in  disaster  prone areas due to severe stress on land, high prices of land and construction of buildings, poverty, migration and non-regulation of urban housing constructions.  Even, the natural protection measures are neglected to pave the  way  for  economic  development.    The  government  of  India  through various stake-holding agencies has been making  efforts to meet the exigencies as arisen by natural disasters.  It is, however, experienced that all these efforts and contingency plans concentrate on the post disaster situation. A  half  backed  approach  is  adopted  for  preventing  the  occurrence  of disasters.  There is need for fundamental change in national disaster policy itself.    The  community  has  to  be  associated  at  all  levels  of  planning  and implementation of the disaster management programmes.

## Urbanization

Urbanization  is  a  global  phenomenon  experienced  by  developed  as well as developing countries. There is migration from villages to towns and

cities  with  results  in  growth  of  metropolitan  cities  since  they  provide multiple avenues, services and amenities viz. education, health care, employment, business and entertainment options etc. People also migrate for economic opportunities  and urban life  styles.  (Though  urbanization  brings about  development  in  social,  economic  and  cultural  spheres  of  life,  it sometimes disturbs the ecological systems. Rapid and unplanned growth of urban agglomerations generates a series of negative environmental effects. Today urban India presents a very pathetic scene. Cities have become a site of  rotting  garbage,  degrading  drainage  system  and  shocking  night  soil removal system. India's life line is in danger. Many Indian rivers are heading towards  an  environmental  disaster  due  to  discharging  of  untreated  sewage into water bodies. Besides, poor have practically no access to sanitary toilets and  in  many  towns  and  cities,  the  majority  defecate  in  the  open.  The untreated  sewage  being  dumped  into  the  river  and  water  bodies  leads  to health hazards.)

India is one of the least urbanized countries in the world. However, it has second largest urban population in the world. As per 2001 Census, 285 million  populations  i.e.  27.8  per  cent  of  1027  million  total  population  of India is residing in 4368 cities and towns in the country, whereas in 1971, 20 per cent population lived in urban areas. In 2021, about two fifth populations are  expected  to  live  in  urban  areas  with  absolute  size  of  550  million populations.  The characteristic of urbanization in India is concentration  of urban  population  in  larger  urban  centres.  About  two-thirds  of  its  urban content  are  found  concentrated  in  class-I  towns  i.e.  towns  with  more  than one  lakh  population.  Four  mega  cities  viz.,  Mumbai,  Kolkata,  Delhi,  and

Chennai with a population of more than 6 millions each in 2001, account for almost one fourth populations living in cities.

In 1901, there was only one million plus city but in 2001, there were 35 such cities. The number of such cities is likely to increase by 75 in 2021 (Table-I.1).  Interestingly,  the  total  population  of  the  country  in  hundred years (1901-2001) increased about four times, the urban population increased about eleven times and the rural population witnessed an increase of about six times, however, the urban content has shown an increase from 10.8 percent in 1901 to 27.8 percent (less than three fold) in 2001.

The annual exponential growth rate of urban population is low. Even, in the recent, the growth has been reported to be declining. There have been just  2.06  percentage  points  increase  in  proportion  of  urban  population  to total  population  during  1991  to  2001.  An  analysis  of  the  distribution  of

urban population by size categories reveals that the process of urbanization in India has been large city oriented. This is proved that a high proportion of urban  population  being  concentrated  in  class-I  cities,  which  has  gone  up systematically over the decades in the last century, the massive increase in proportion  of  class-I  cities  from  26  per  cent  in  1901  to  85.20  per  cent  in 1991while it declined to 68.67 per cent in 2001, has been attributed to faster growth of large cities. The number of class one cities has grown to 423 in 2001 from 24 in 1901. There has been more than five fold increase in the number of class one cities since 1951 (Table- I.2).

The startling fact is that the proportion of population living in smaller towns  has  shown  declining  trend  over  the  period  while  there  is  massive growth in population of larger towns. Importantly, growth of population in smaller  towns  has  been  reported  negative  while  growth  of  population  in larger  cities  and  towns  has  been  found  massive.  During  2001,  the  high proportion of urban population to total population has been reported to be in Delhi,  Pondicherry,  Goa,  Chandigarh,  Maharastra,  Mizoram,  Lakshadeep, Tamil  Nadu,  Karnataka,  Gujarat  etc.  The  high  rate  of  growth  of  urban population  during  1991-2001  has  been  reported  high  in  Dadra  and  Nagar Haveli  (14.59  per  cent)  followed  by  Arunachal  Pradesh  (7.00  per  cent), Andman Nicobar (4.14 per cent), Sikkim (4.83 per cent), and Delhi, (4.14 per cent).  During 2002, there were 384 urban local bodies in India. Out of total urban local bodies in India, 107 ULB's were Municipal Corporations, 1443 Municipal Councils and 2091 Nagar Panchayats. The highest number of  local  bodies  were  reported  in  Tamil  Nadu  (719)  followed  by  Uttar Pradesh (628), Madhya Pradesh and Maharastra.

Increasing urbanization, expansion of habitat into unsuitable vulnerable areas; higher population density, higher housing density, vulnerable  housing  and  buildings  construction;  non  engineered  unsafe construction;  and  aging  buildings  and  other  infrastructure  are  some  of  the factors  that  have  increased  vulnerability  of  hazards  and  disasters  in  urban areas.

Thus,  disaster  risk  management  includes  measures  which  reduce disaster related losses of life, property or assets by either reducing the hazard or vulnerability of the elements at risk. Disaster management is

conceptualized  as  the  body  of  policy  and  administrative  decisions  and operational activities which pertain to the various stages of a disaster at all levels.    Broadly  disaster  management  can  be  divided  into  pre-disaster  and post-disaster contexts. There are three key stages of activity that are taken up within disaster management. They are (i) pre-disaster-mitigation, prevention, preparedness,  risk  assessment;  (ii)  during  a  disaster-emergency  response, relief distribution, search and rescue, shelter, medical and trauma care etc., (iii) post disaster-rehabilitation and  reconstruction of disaster affected persons and areas.

## An Overview

The  Indian  subcontinent  is  vulnerable  to  droughts,  floods,  cyclones and earthquakes. Land slides, avalanche and forest fires also occur frequently (Table- 1.3).

Among  the  32  states  and  Union  Territories  in  the  country,  22  are multi-disaster  prone.  About  40  million  hectares  of  land  in  the  country  has been identified as flood prone and on an average 18.6 million hectare of land is flooded annually. About 57 per cent of area of the country is vulnerable to seismic activity. About 18 per cent of country's total area is drought prone, approximately  50  million  people  are  annually  affected  by  droughts  and about 68 per cent of total sown area of the country is drought prone. India has  a  long  coastline  of  8040  km.  which  is  exposed  to  tropical  cyclones arising in  the  Bay  of  Bengal, the  Arabian  Sea  and  Indian  Sea.  The  Indian Ocean  is  one  of  the  six  major  cyclonic  prone  regions  of  the  globe.  The

Coromandal coastline is more cyclones prone, with 80 per cent of the total cyclones  generated  in  this  region.  Risk  to  the  existing  housing  stock  in various states and union-territories had been estimated by Expert Group Set up by the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India. About 3.9 million houses are susceptible to earthquakes of very high intensity, about 20  million  houses  are  susceptible  to  damage  due  to  winds  and  about  9.3 million houses are susceptible to damage due to floods. Besides the risk of earth  quakes,  cyclones  and  floods  are  liable  to  very  high  damage  and destruction of vulnerable houses under heavy rains. Some 49 per cent of the total housing stock is liable to very high damage from natural hazards, while about 1 per cent of the total housing stock gets destroyed every year. It is to be  noted  that  in  earth  quake,  80  per  cent  of  the  casualties  are  due  to collapsing buildings. Brick and stone buildings without proper support are liable to collapse. Non-engineered buildings continue to be built in the areas prone to natural disasters. Unemployment, poverty backwardness, migration from  rural  areas  and  increasing  price  of  land  and  construction,  million  of people are occupying disaster prone areas. Thus about 6 per cent increase in disaster affected population has been reported.

According to the World Bank assessment, the natural disasters alone accounted  India whopping  amount  of  $13  million  during  1986-2001, depleting  2  per  cent  of  the  GDP  and  12  per  cent  of  national  revenue. Compared  to  the  loss  of  $13.4  billion  during  1981-95  and  $2.9  million during  1965-80,  the  present  swelling  in  the  volume  of  losses  is  certainly frightening  and  demands  urgent  attention  of  development  planners.  The dilapidated  and  poorly  built  houses  in  urban  areas  increase  the  risks  of

disasters.    Lack  of  tenurial  rights  over  the  urban  space  and  shortage  of housing  facilities  have  forced  to  urban  poor  to  live  in  the  most  unsafe environment. The Indian sub-continent is highly prone to natural disasters. Floods, droughts, cyclones and earthquakes are a recurrent phenomenon in India.  Between 1988 and 1997 disaster Killed 5116 people and affected 2479 million every year (Table -1.4).

The changing topography due to environmental degradation has also increased the vulnerability in the country. In 1988, 11.2 per cent of total land area was flood prone, but in 1998 floods inundated 37 per cent geographical area. Three major disasters that India have experienced in the recent past are

the  super  cyclone  in  Orissa  (1999),  earthquake  in  Gujarat  (2001)  and Tsunami (2004) in Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, Andaman Nicobar Islands and parts of other southern states. Frequent disasters lead to erosion of development gains and restricted options threatened by hazards.

The  continent  of  Asia  is  particularly  vulnerable  to  disasters  strikes. Between the years 1991 to 2000 Asia has accounted for 83 per cent of the population affected by disasters globally. Within Asia, 24 per cent of deaths due  to  disasters  occurred  in  India,  on  account  of  its  size  population  and vulnerability. Floods and high winds account for 60 per cent of all disasters in India. Many parts of the Indian sub-continent are susceptible to different types of disasters owing to the unique topography and climatic characteristics. About  54  per  cent  of  the  sub  continent's  landmass  is vulnerable  to  earthquakes  while  about  4  crore  hectares  is  vulnerable  to periodic floods.  The country has suffered four major earthquakes in the span of  last  50  years  along-with  a  series  of  moderate  intensity  earthquakes  that have occurred at regular intervals.  Since 1988, six earth quakes have struck different parts of the country. Tsunami in India killed 10749 persons while $1068 million loss or damage to properties was reported.

## CHAPTER-II

## HAZARDS AND DISASTERS

Hazard may be conceptualized as a dangerous condition or events that threaten or have the potential for causing injury to life or damage to property or the environment. They can be categorized in various ways but, they are basically grouped in two broad headings:

- 1. Natural  Hazards  (hazards  with  meteorological,  geological  or  even biological origin)
- 2. Unnatural  Hazards  (hazards  with  human-caused  or  technological origin)

It  is  also  important  to  know  that  natural  phenomena  are  extreme climatologically, hydrological, or geological, processes that do not pose any threat to persons or property. A massive earthquake in an unpopulated area is a natural phenomenon, not a hazard . It is when these natural phenomena interact with the man made environment or fragile areas which causes wide spread damage.

Hazards  may  be  grouped  into  two  broad  categories,  namely  natural and manmade. Natural hazards are those hazards which are caused because of natural phenomenon.  Cyclones,  tsunamis,  earthquake,  and  volcanic eruption  are  exclusively  of  natural  origin.  Manmade  hazards  are  hazards which occur due to human negligence. Manmade hazards are associated with industries or energy generation facilities and include explosions, leakage of toxic  waste,  pollution,  dam  failure,  wars  or  civil  strife  etc.  There  may  be

another category which  includes  landslides, floods, drought, fires are socio-natural hazards since their causes are both natural and manmade.

Hazard  refers  to  the  potential  occurrence,  in  a  specific  time  period, and  geographic  area,  of  a  natural  phenomenon  that  may  adversely  affect human life, properly or activity to the extent of causing a disaster. A hazard occurrence becomes a disaster when it results in loss of life, displacements and  homelessness,  destruction  and  damage  to  infrastructure  and  property. Methods of predicting various hazards and the likelihood and frequency of occurrence vary widely by type of hazard.

Risk  refers  to  the  expected  or  anticipated  losses  (lives  lost,  people injured, properly damaged, and economic activities or livelihoods disrupted) from the impact of a given hazard on a given element at risk over a specific period of time.

## Vulnerability

Vulnerability may  be  conceptualized  as the extent to which  a community structure, service, or geographic area is likely to be damaged or disrupted  by  the  impact  of  particular  hazard  on  account  of  their  nature, construction and proximity to hazardous terrain or a disaster prone area.  The vulnerable buildings and  infrastructure are more  prone  to  earthquake hazards.  Hence structures should be built strong enough to resist maximum force exerted by any event or for combination of event. Social and economic conditions  also  determine  the  vulnerability  of  a  society  to  an  extent. Interestingly,  risk  is  a  measure  of  the  expected  losses  (deaths,  injuries, property, economic activity etc.) due to a hazard of a particular magnitude occurring  in  a  given  area  over  a  specific  time  period.    The  level  of  risk

depends  upon  (i)  nature  of  the  hazard;  (ii)  vulnerability  of  the  elements which are affected; and (iii) economic value of those elements.

Vulnerability  is  defined  as 'The  extent  to  which  a  community, structure, service, or geographic area is likely to be damaged or disrupted by the impact of particular hazard, on account of their nature, construction and proximity to hazardous terrain or a disaster prone area."

Human  vulnerability  is  the  relative  lack  of  capacity  of  a  person  or community to anticipate, cope with, resist and recover forms the impact of a hazard. Vulnerability has two components. One is the exposure to hazards and the other is the difficulty in coping with and recovering from them (due to lack of resources). Human vulnerability increases with:

- (a) Rapid urbanization
- (b) Population growth
- (c) Lack of knowledge about how to effectively resist the effects of disasters.
- (d) Poverty

Physical Vulnerability: It is the extent to which a structure is likely to be damaged or disrupted by a hazard event. It assumes importance in case of earthquakes.

Economic Vulnerability: It  is  the  extent  to  which  the  economic  activities such as employment generation in services, trade, industrial and agricultural production  is  disrupted  or  likely  to  be  damaged.  Economic  vulnerability affects the reconstruction work directly.

## Disasters

The  term  'disaster'  owes  its  origin  to  the  French  World  ' Desastre " which  refers  to  bad  or  evil  star.  A  disaster  can  be  defined  as  'a  serious disruption  in  the  functioning  of  the  community  or  a  society  causing  wide spread material, economic, social or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected society to cope using its own resources.' A disaster is a result from the combination of hazard, vulnerability and insufficient capacity or measures to reduce the potential changes of risk. A disaster is the product of  a  hazard  such  as  earthquake,  flood  or  wind  storm  coinciding  with  a vulnerable situation which might include communities, cities or villages. A disaster  happens  when  hazard  impose  on  the  vulnerable  population  and causes  damage,  casualties  and  disruption.  Without  vulnerability  or  hazard there is no disaster. A disaster occurs when hazards and vulnerability meet. Hazard, thus may be termed as a dangerous condition or event that threat or has  the  potential  for  causing  injury  to  life  or  damage  to  property  or  the environment.

There  has  been  increase  in  the  number  of  natural  disasters  over  the past  years,  on  account  of  urbanization  and  population  growth;  as  a  result impact of natural disasters is now felt to a larger extent. According to the United  Nations,  in  2001  alone,  natural  disasters  of  medium  to  high  range caused  at  least  250,000  deaths  around  the  world,  more  than  double  the previous  year,  and  economic  losses  of  around  836  billion.  The  natural disasters  are  not  bound  by  political  boundaries  and  have  no  social  or economic considerations. They are borderless as they affect both developing and  developed  countries.  Since  1991,  two  third  of  the  victims  of  natural disasters  were  from  developing countries, while just 2 per cent were from highly developed nations. Those living in developing countries and

especially those with limited resources tend to be more adversely affected. The continent of Asia is particularly vulnerable to disaster strikes.

A  disaster  is  the  product  of  a  hazard  such  as  earthquake,  flood  or windstorm  coinciding  with  a  vulnerable  situation  which  might  include communities,  cities  or  villages.  There  are  two  main  components  in  this definition: hazard and vulnerability. Without vulnerability or hazard there is no disaster. A disaster occurs when hazards and vulnerability meet.

There are several important characteristics that make disasters different from accidents. The loss of a sole income earner in a car crash may be a disaster to a family, but only an accident to the community. Variables such as causes, frequency, and duration of the impact, speed of onset, and scope  of  the  impact,  destructive  potential,  and  human  vulnerability  etc determine the difference.

Disasters  are  events  that  disrupt  the  functioning  of  a  society.  They cause widespread human, material, or environmental losses that exceed the ability of the affected society using its own resources. Earthquakes, floods, and  cyclones,  landslides  are  not  disasters  in  themselves.  They  become disasters  when  human  life,  livelihoods  and  properly  are  adversely  and severely affected.

There  are  different  ways  to  classify  disasters.  Disasters  are  often classified  according  to  their  cause,  their  speed  of  onset  (sudden  or  slow). Disasters  classified  according  to  cause  are  named  after  the  hazard,  which results  in  the  disastrous  social  and  economic  consequences.  Thus,  this classification  includes  earthquakes,  floods,  cyclones,  tornadoes,  landslides, mudflows, droughts, pest and insect infestation, etc. (Chart- 2.1)

## Speed of onset

The speed of the disaster's onset is another way to distinguish between disasters  and  the  types  of  responses  that  may  be  required.  A  rapid  onset disaster refers to an event or hazard that occurs suddenly, with little warning, taking the lives of people, and destroying economic structures and material resources.  Earthquakes,  floods,  storm  winds,  tornadoes,  may  cause  such disasters  or  mud  flows.  Slow  onset  disasters  occur  over  time  and  slowly deteriorate a society's and a population's capacity to withstand the effects of the  hazard  or  threat.  Hazards  causing  these  disaster  conditions  typically include  droughts,  famines,  environmental  degradation,  desertification,  and deforestation and pest infestation.(Chart -2.2)

## CLASSIFICATION OF DISASTERS

Disasters are often classified according to their speed of onset i.e. sudden or slow.

- 1. Sudden onset disasters  (Rapid  onset  disasters)  e.g.  earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, tropical storms, volcanic eruptions, landslides, etc. (mostly geological and climatic disasters).
- 2. Slow  onset  disasters e.g. drought,  famine, land-depredation, climate change, desertification, deforestation, pest infestation.

## Popular Classification of Disasters

## (i) Natural Disasters

- 1.  Heavy Rains, 2. Floods, 3. Draughts, 4. Earthquake, 5. Volcano Eruption,
- 6.    Avalanche,    7.    Landslide,    8.  Epidemic,  9.  Cyclone,    10.  Heat  Wave, Cold Wave.

## (ii) Manmade Disasters

- (a)   Un-Intentional or Inadvertent:
- (1) Poor Maintenance, (2) Low Quality Work, (3) Human Error
- (b)   Wilfully and Intentional:
- 1. Sabotage, 2. Mischief, 3. Revenge. 4. Riots, 5. Mob Furry,
- 6. Enemy Attack
- (c)   Industrial and Technological - (Mostly system/Process Malfunction)
- 1. Nuclear Radiation. 2. Gas Leak. 3. Explosion. 4. Fire

## Nature Based classification of Disasters

## 1. Elemental Disasters

- (a) Earthquake
- (b) Tidal waves
- (c) Floods
- (d) Volcanic eruptions
- (e) Landslides

## 2. Foreseeable Disasters

- (a) Famines
- (b) Epidemics

## 3. Deliberate Disasters

- (a) Wars
- (b) Civil wars
- (c) Guerrilla warfare
- (d) Insurgency activities
- (e) Terrorism

## 4. Accidental Disasters

- (a) Industrial catastrophes
- (b) Nuclear Catastrophes

Elemental  disasters are  distinguished  from  other  disasters  because they are instantaneous and prompted, by climatic or geological forces. Their destructive capability depends more on the number of vulnerable people in a given area than on their inherent severity. In many parts of the world, manmade errors exacerbate the damage such elemental disasters cause.

Foreseeable disasters have complex root causes in which climatic and human  activity  interact  over  extended  periods,  leaving  large  numbers  of people  vulnerable.  Such  as  interaction  creates  a  vicious  circle  whose recurrence is often predictable.

Deliberate  disasters have  roots in social economic  and  politics inequity.  This  can  result  in  both  high  intensity  hostile  enemy  actions  in forms of declared battles or wars or low intensity conflicts such as guerrilla warfare,  terrorism,  sabotage,  riots,  communal  discord  or  riots,  civil  strife, internal disturbance, arson or crowd violence.

Accidental disasters are a byproduct of negligence of risk-assessment while  making  scientific  and  technological  advances.  Recent  incidents  of Bhopal, Chernobyl, Three Mile Island etc. attest to the grave threat posed by such disasters.

As  per  another  classification  based  on  predominant  agent,  disasters could  be  categorized  as  of  three  types,  i.e.  first  the  natural,  secondly  the man-made, and lastly as hybrid disasters.

Natural  disasters are  the  result  of  natural  phenomena,  for  instance, earthquake, volcanic eruption, hurricane, tornado, avalanche or flood.

Man-made disasters are  of  an  anthropogenic  origin,  and  exemplifies some  of  the  terrible  accidents  that  have  resulted  from  human  beings interaction with artificial environment, which they themselves have created.

Hybrid  Disasters arise  from  a  linkage  of  anthropogenic  events  and natural events. For example, spread of disease from a community in which the  disease  is  endemic  to  a  community  which  has  no  natural  immunity, destruction of forests and resulting increased floods; large scale deaths due to smog, etc.

## Significant Disasters

Blizzards and Snowstorms: A snowstorm is a winter storm in which the primary form of precipitation is snow. When such a storm is accompanied by winds above 32 mph that severely reduce visibility, it becomes a blizzard. Hazards  from  snowstorms  and  blizzards  include  traffic-related  accidents, hypothermia for those unable to find shelter, as well as major disruptions to transportation and fuel and power distribution system.

Drought: A  drought  is  a  long-lasting  weather  pattern  consisting  of  dry conditions with very little or no precipitation. During his period, food and water supplies can run low, and other conditions, such as famine, can result. Droughts can last for several years and are particularly damaging in areas in which the residents depend on agriculture for survival.

Earthquakes: An earthquake is a sudden shift or movement in the tectonic plate in the Earth's crust. On the surface, this is manifested by a moving and shaking  of  the  ground,  and  can  be  massively  damaging  to  poorly  built structures. The most powerful earthquakes can destroy even the best built of structures. In addition, they can trigger secondary disasters, such as tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Earthquakes occur along fault line, and are

unpredictable. They are capable of killing hundreds of thousands of people, such as in the 1976 Tangshan and 2004 Indian Ocean earthquakes.

Epidemic: An epidemic is a massive outbreak and spread of an infectious disease,  and  is  historically  the  most  dangerous  of  all  natural  disasters. Different epidemics are caused by different diseases, and different epidemics have  included  the  Black  Death,  smallpox,  and  AIDS.  The  Spanish  flu  of 1918 was the deadliest  ever  epidemic,  it  killed  25-40  million  people.  The Black  Death,  which  occurred  in  the  14th  Century,  killed  over  20  million people, one third of Europe's population.

Famine: Famine is a natural disaster characterized by a widespread lack of food in a region, and can be characterized as a lack of agriculture foodstuffs, a  lack  of  livestock,  or  a  general  lack  of  all  foodstuffs  required  for  basic nutrition  and  survival.  Famine  is  almost  always  caused  by  pre-existing conditions,  such  as  drought,  but  its  effects  may  be  exacerbated  by  social factors, such as war. Particularly devastating examples include the Ethiopian famine and the Irish Potato Famine.

Flood: A flood is a natural disaster caused by too much rain or water in a location, and could be caused by many different sets of conditions. Floods can be caused by prolonged rainfall from a storm, including thunderstorms, rapid melting of large amounts of snow, or rivers which swell from excess precipitation upstream and cause widespread damage to areas downstream, or  less  frequently  the  bursting  of  man-made  dams.  A  river  which  floods particularly  often  is  the  Huang  He  in  China,  and  a  particularly  damaging flood was the Great Flood of 1993.

Forest  Fire: A  forest  fire  is  a  natural  disaster  consisting  of  a  fire  which destroys  a  forested  area,  and  can  be  a  great  danger  to  people  who  live  in forests as well as wildlife. Forest fires are generally started by lightning but also  by  human  negligence  or  arson,  and  can  burn  thousands  of  square kilometers.

Hailstorm: A hailstorm is a natural disaster where a thunderstorm produces a numerous amount of hailstones which damage the location in which they fall.  Hailstorms  can  be  especially  devastating to  farm  fields,  ruining  crops and  damaging  equipment.  A  particularly  damaging  hailstorm  hit  Munich, Germany  on  August  31,  1986,  felling  thousands  of  trees  and  causing millions of dollars in insurance claims.

Heat  Wave: A  heat  wave  is  a  disaster  characterized  by  heat  which  is considered extreme and unusual in the area in which it occurs. Heat waves are rare and require specific combinations of weather events to take place, and may include temperature inversions, katabatic winds, or other phenomena. The worst heat wave in recent history was the European Heat Wave of 2003.

Hurricanes: A hurricane is a cyclonic storm system which forms over the oceans. It is caused by evaporated water which comes off of the ocean and becomes  a  storm.  The  Coriolis  Effect  causes  the  storms  to  spin,  and  a hurricane is declared when this spinning mass of storms attains a wind speed greater than 74mph. In different parts of the world hurricanes are known as cyclones or typhoons. The former occur in the Indian Ocean, which the latter occur in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The most damaging hurricane ever was Hurricane Andrew, which hit southern Florida in 1992.

Ice Storm: An ice storm is a particular weather event in which precipitation falls as rain, due to atmosphere conditions, but the in an area in which the temperature  is  below  the  freezing  point  of    water.  The  rain  falls  to  the ground, and immediately turns to ice, accumulating in that fashion. A heavy ice storm can cause large accumulations of ice cause trees to fall over or lose branches, and power lines to snap. The worst recent ice storm was the 1998 Ice Storm that struck eastern Canada and areas of the US northeast.

Lahar: A  lahar  is  a  type  of  natural  disaster  closely  related  to  a  volcanic eruption, and involves a large amount of material; including mud, rock, and ash sliding down the side of the volcano at a rapid pace. These flows can destroy entire towns in seconds and kill thousands of people. The Tangiwai disaster  in  an  excellent  example,  as  is  the  one  which  killed  an  estimated 23,000 people in Armero, Colombia, during the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz.

Landslides and Mudslides: A  landslide  is  a  disaster  closely  related  to  an avalanche,  but  instead  of  occurring  with  snow,  it  occurs  involving  actual elements  of  the  ground,  including  rocks,  trees,  and  parts  of  houses,  and anything else which may happen to be swept up. Landslides can be caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or general instability in the surrounding land.  Mudslides,  or  mud  flows,  are  a  special  case  of  landslides,  in  which heavy  rainfall  causes  loose  soil  on  steep  terrain  to  collapse  and  slide downwards;  these  occur  with  some  regularity  in  parts  of  California  after periods of heavy rain.

Sinkholes: A localized depression in the surface topography, usually caused by the collapse of a subterranean structure, such as a cave. Although rare,

large  sinkholes  that  develop  suddenly  in  populated  areas  can  lead  to  the collapse of buildings and other structures.

Tornado: A  tornado  is  a  natural  disaster  resulting  from  a  thunderstorm. Tornadoes are violent  currents  of  wind  which  can  blow  at  up  to  318mph. Tornadoes can occur one at a time, or can occur in large tornado outbreaks along a squall line. The worst tornado ever recorded in terms of wind speed was the tornado which swept through Moore, Oklahoma on May 3, 1999. This  tornado  has  wind  speeds  of  318mph  and  was  the  strongest  ever recorded.

Tsunami: A tsunami is a giant wave of water which rolls into the shore of an area with a height of over 15 m (50 ft.). It comes from Japanese words meaning harbor and wave. Tsunami can be caused by under sea earthquakes as  in  the  2004  Indian  Ocean  Earthquake,  or  by  landslides  such  as  the  one which occurred at Lituya Bay, Alaska. The tsunami generated by the 2004 Indian  Ocean  Earthquake  currently  ranks  as  the  deadliest  tsunami  in recorded  history.  The  highest  Tsunami  ever  recorded  was  estimated  to  be 85m (278 ft.) high. It appeared off Ishigaki Island, Japan.

Volcanic  Eruption: This  natural  disaster  is  caused  by  the  eruption  of  a volcano, and eruptions come in many forms. They range from daily small eruptions  which  occur  in  places;  like  Kilauea,  in  Hawali,  or  extremely infrequent supervolvano  eruptions  in  places  like Lake  Toba.  Greatest Volcanic explosion occurred when Krakatoa in Indonesia blew up in 1883, hurling  rocks  55km  (34  miles)  in  the  air!  The  explosion  was  heard  in Australia and generated a 40m. (131 ft.) High Tsunami; 36,000 people died. The greatest volcanic eruption was of Mt.Tambora on Sumbawa, Indonesia

in 1815 which threw up more than 100 cubic km. (24cu. miles) of ash. The island was lowered by 1250m (4100 ft.); 92,000 people died.

Ice Age: An ice age is a geologic period, but could also be viewed in the light  of  a  catastrophic  natural  disaster,  since  in  an  ice  age,  the  climate  all over  the  world  would  change  and  places  which  were  once  considered habitable would then be too cold in permanently inhabit. A side effect of an ice age could possibly be a famine, caused by a worldwide drought.

Volcano: A  super volcano is a eruption which is thousands of times more massive than a normal eruption, the lower threshold for an eruption being declared that of a super volcano is that such an eruption must expel at least 1000  cubic  kilometers  of  material.  The  last  eruption  of  this  magnitude occurred  over  75,000  year  ago  at  Lake  Toba.  If  such  an  eruption  were  to occur today, a wholesale general die-off of both animals and humans would occur, as well as a significant short-term climate change.

Risk reduction can take place in two ways:

## Chapter-3 EARTHQUAKE

The  Indian  sub-continent  lies  upon  the  Indian  plate  which  is  moving northward  and  collides  with  the  Eurasian  Plate.    Due  to  this  collision,  the Himalayas are generated in the process.  This is the main cause of earthquakes from  Himalayas  to  the  Arakan  Yoma.    The  same  process,  results  in earthquakes  in  Andaman  and  Nicobar  Islands.    Sometimes  earthquakes  of different  magnitudes  occur  within  the  Indian  Plate.    The  location  of  Indian ubcontinent is found to be valuable in the center of seismic activities.  During last 200 years 712 earthquakes have occurred in Indian sub continent.  Some of the significant earthquakes are shown in table 3.1

Earthquakes with magnitudes in excess of 7.0 have occurred in these areas, and have had intensities higher than IX.  Most of the earthquakes which occurred  were  rated  at  5-6  scale  (60  per  cent)  while  more  than  one  third earthquakes were in between 6-7 Richter scale.  Again, about half of the earth quakes have occurred in North East India alone (Table - 3.2)

During  the  earthquakes,  majority  of  losses  is  due  to  collapse  of buildings and damage to infrastructure.  More than half of the houses are built

with  stone  walls  and  35  per  cent  have  burnt  brick  units  which  are  highly vulnerable to sustain damage of seismic intensities namely VII, VIII and IX.

Several key factors that contribute to vulnerability of human populations to earthquakes:

- · Location of settlements in an earthquake prone area, especially on soft ground, on area prone to landslides or along fault lines.
- · Dense collection of weak buildings with high occupancy.
- · Non-engineered buildings constructed by earth, rubble, buildings with heavy roofs (more vulnerable than light weight structures), poor quality and maintenance of buildings
- · Weak or flexible storey intending for parking purposes.

## HAZARD ZONES

As per the latest seismic zoning map of India the country is divided into four Seismic Zones. Zone V marked in red shows the area of Very High Risk Zone, Zone IV marked in orange shows the area of High Risk Zone. Zone III marked  in  yellow  shows  the  region  of  Moderate  Risk  Zone  and  Zone  II marked  in  blue  shows  the  region  of  Low  Risk  Zone.  Zone  V  is  the  most vulnerable  to  earthquakes,  where  historically  some  of  the  country's  most powerful shock has occurred.

As per India's Seismic Vulnerability Atlas, 58 cities of India fall within seismic vulnerability Zones.  Out of which 13 cities are located in Zone V, 16 Cities in Zone IV and 29 cities are situated in Zone III (Table - 3.3)

Geographically this zone includes the Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands, all of  North-Eastern  India,  parts  of  north-western  Bihar,  eastern  sections  of Uttaranchal, the Kangra Valley in Himachal Pradesh, near the Srinagar area in Jammu  &amp;  Kashmir  and  the  Rann  of  Kutchh  in  Gujarat.  Earthquakes  with magnitudes  in  excess  of  7.0  have  occurred  in  these  areas,  and  have  had intensities higher than IX.

Much of India lies in Zone III, where a maximum intensity of VII can be expected. New Delhi lies in Zone IV whereas Mumbai and Chennai lie in Zone III. All states and UTs across the country have experienced earthquakes. The  magnitude  of  the  earthquake  is  also  influenced  by  the  sensitivity  of geographical areas depending upon the tectonic location of the land.

The effects of earthquake may in change physical damage to property, humanism  and  also  disrupt  the  social  and  infrastructural  services  due  to occurasion of earthquakes. Damage  or  loss  of  buildings and  service structures, fires, floods due to dam failures, landslides could occur.

The casualties often high, near to the epi-center and in places where the population density is high (say, multistoried buildings) and structures are not resistant  to  earthquake  forces.    Multiple  fracture  injuries,  moderately  and severely  injured  is  the  most  widespread  problem,  breakdown  in  sanitary conditions  and  large  number  of  casualties  could  lead  to  epidemics.    Severe problems due to failure of the water supply distribution network and storage reservoirs are noticed. Fire hydrants supply lines if vulnerable could hamper fire service operations.  Transport network is generally severely affected due to failure of roads and bridges, railway tracks, failure of airport runways and related  infrastructure.    Electricity  and  Communication  also  affect  due  to collapse of transmission towers, transponders, transformers etc.

## MITIGATION STRATEGIES

Engineered  structures (designed  and  built)  to  withstand  ground  shaking. Architectural and engineering inputs put together to improve building design and  construction  practice. Analyze  soil  type before  construction  and  do  not build  structures  on  soft  soil.  To  accommodate  on  weak  soils  adopt  safety measures in design.

- · Follow Indian Standard Codes for construction of buildings.
- · Enforcement of the Byelaws including Land use control and restriction on density and heights of buildings

- · Strengthening of important lifeline buildings which need to be functional  after  a  disaster.  Upgrade  level  of  safety  of  hospital,  fire service buildings etc.
- · Public awareness , sensitization and training programmes for A rchitects, B uilders, C ontractors, D esigners, E ngineers, F inanciers, G overnment functionaries, H ouse  owners, M asons  etc.  Reduce  possible  damages from  secondary  effects  such  as  like  fire,  floods,  landslides  etc.  e.g. identify potential landslide sites and restrict construction in those areas. The  principles  and  construction  features  for  earthquake  resistance structure are shown in chart-2.2

## COMMUNITY BASED MITIGATION

Community  preparedness along  with  public  education  is  vital  for mitigating  the  earthquake  impact  earthquake  drills  and  public  awareness programme. Community  based  Earthquake  Risk  Management  Project should  be  developed  and  sustainable  programmes  launched.  Retrofitting  of schools and important buildings, purchase of emergency response equipment and  facilities,  establishing  proper  insurance  can  be  the  programmes  under Earthquake Risk Management Project. A large number of local masons and engineers may be trained in disaster resistant construction techniques. A large number of masons, engineers and architects can get trained in this process.

## A Guide to Earthquake Reduction

## (i) Prepare a Home Earthquake Plan

-  Choose  a  safe  place  in  every  room-under  a  sturdy  table  or  desk  or against an inside wall where nothing can fall on you.
-  Practice drop, cover, and hold on . Drop under a sturdy desk or table, hold on, and protect your eyes by pressing your face against your arm. If there's no table or desk nearby, sit on the floor against an interior wall

away  from  windows  or  tall  furniture  that  could  fall  on  you.  Teach children to drop, cover, and hold on.

-  Choose an out-of-town family contact.
-  Consult a professional to find out additional ways to protect your home, by implementing structural mitigation techniques.
-  Take a first aid class.
-  Get training in how to use a fire extinguisher.
-  Bolt bookcases, kichten cabinets, and other tall furniture to wall studs.

## (ii) Prepare a Disaster Supplies Kit for Home-

-  First aid kit and essential medications.
-  Potable water.
-  Protective clothing, rainwear, and bedding.
-  Battery-powered radio, flashlight, and extra batteries.
-  Special items for infant, elderly, or disabled family members.
-  Identify where you could go if told to evacuate. Choose safe places-a relative's/friend's home in another town, a motel, or a shelter.

## (iii)    What to Do when the Shaking Begins

-  Drop,  cover,  and  hold  on .  Move  only  a  few  steps  to  a  nearby  safe place.  Stay  indoors until  the  shaking stops  and  you're  sure it's  safe  to exit. Stay away from windows. In a high-rise building, expect the fire alarms and sprinklers to Government off during a quake.
-  If  you are in bed, hold on and stay there, protecting your head with a pillow.

-  If  you  are  outdoors,  find  a  clear  spot  away  from  buildings,  trees,  and power lines. Drop to the ground.
-  If you are in a car, slow down and drive to a clear place (as described above). Stay in the car until the shaking stops.

## (iv) What to Do After the Shaking Stops

-  Check  yourself  for  injuries.  Protect  yourself  from  further  danger  by putting  on  long  pants,  a  long-sleeved  shirt,  sturdy  shoes,  and  work gloves.
-  Check others for injuries. Give first aid for serious injuries.
-  Look for and extinguish small fires. Eliminate fire hazards.
-  Listen to the radio/TV for instructions.
-  Expect aftershocks. Each time you feel one, drop, cover, and hold on.
-  Inspect  your  home  for  damage.  Get  everyone  out  if  your  home  is unsafe.

## (v) Make Your Home Fire Safe

-  Smoke alarms save lives. Install a smoke alarm outside sleeping area and on additional levels of your home.
-  If people sleep with doors closed, install smoke alarms inside sleeping areas, too.
-  Use  the  test  button  to  check  each  smoke  alarm  once  a  month.  When necessary,  replace batteries  immediately.  Replace  all  batteries  at  least once a year.
-  Clean cobwebs and dust from your smoke alarms monthly.

- 
- Consider having one or more working fire extinguishers in your home. Get training from the fire department in how to use them.

## (vi) Plan Your Escape Routes

-  Determine at least two ways to escape from every room of your home.
-  Consider escape ladders for sleeping areas on the second or third floor. Learn how to use them and store them near the window.
-  Select a location outside your home where everyone would meet after escaping.
-  Practice your escape plan at least twice a year.

## (vii) Escape Safely

-  Once you are out, stay out! Call the fire department.
-  If you see smoke or fire in your first escape route, use your second way out. If you must exit through smoke, crawl low under the smoke to your exit.
-  If you are escaping through a closed door, feel the door before opening it. If it is warm, use your second way out.
-  Smoke, heat, or flames block your exit routes, stay in the room with the door closed. Signal for help using a bright-colored cloth at the window.

If  there  is  a  telephone  in  the  room,  call  the  fire brigade  and  tell  them where you are.

The recent tsunami strike in December 2004 severely hit the coastal states of Tamil  Nadu,  Kerala,  Andhra  Pradesh  and  union  territory  of  Andaman Nicobar Islands.  According to Government reports, 10739 people in India lost their lives and 6913 were injured.  It was reported that 5640 persons are still  missing.    The  highest  human  losses  were  in  the  Andaman  Nicobar Islands  and  the  state  of  Tamil  Nadu.    Overall  damages  were  estimated  at about $660 million and losses to $410 million (UN, 2005).

## CONCEPT AND CAUSES

If  the  earthquake  or  under  water  land  movement  is  near  the  coast  then tsunami may strike suddenly and if the earth movement is far in the sea then it  may  take  few  minutes  to  hours  before  striking  the  coast.  The  onset  is extensive  and  often  very  destructive.  The  general  causes  of  Tsunamis  are geological  movements.  It  is  produced  in three  major  ways . The  most common of these is fault  movement  on  the  sea  floor,  accompanied  by  an earthquake. To say that an earthquake causes a tsunami is not completely correct. Rather, both earthquakes and tsunamis result from fault movements. Probably the second most common cause of tsunamis is a landslide either occurring underwater or originating above the sea and then plunging into the water. The third major cause of tsunamis is volcanic activity . The flank of a volcano, located near the shore or underwater, may be uplifted or depressed similar  to  the  action  of  a  fault.  Or,  the  volcano  may  actually  explode.  In 1883, the violent explosion of the famous volcano, Krakatoa in Indonesia, produced  tsunamis  measuring  40  meters  which  crashed  upon  Java  and Sumatra.  Over 36,000 people lost their  lives  as  a  result  of  tsunami  waves from Krakatoa. The giant tsunamis that are capable of crossing oceans are

nearly  always  created  by  movement  of  the  sea  floor  associated  with earthquakes which occur beneath the sea floor or near the ocean.

Tsunami is not a single giant wave. It consists of ten or more waves which are termed as a 'tsunami wave train'. Since scientists cannot predict when earthquakes will occur, they cannot predict exactly when a tsunami will be generated.  Studies  of  past  historical  tsunamis  indicate  where  tsunamis  are most  likely  to  be  generated,  their  potential  heights,  and  flooding  limits  at specific  coastal locations.  With  use  of  satellite  technology  it  is  possible  to provide nearly immediate warnings of potentially tsunamigenic earthquakes. Warning  time  depends  upon  the  distance  of  the  epi-center  from  the  coast line. The warning includes predicted times at selected coastal communities where  the  tsunami  could  travel  in  a  few  hours.  In  case  of  tsunami  genie earthquakes or any other geological activity people near to the coastal areas may get very little time to evacuate on receiving of warning.

All structures located within 200 mts. of the low lying coastal area are most vulnerable to the direct impact of the tsunami waves as well as the impact of debris  &amp;  boulders  brought  by  it.  Settlements  in  adjacent  areas  will  be vulnerable to floods &amp; scour. Structures constructed of wood, mud, thatch, sheets and structures without proper anchorage to foundations are liable to be  damaged  by  tsunami  waves  &amp;  flooding.  Other  elements  at  risk  are infrastructure facilities like ports &amp; harbours, telephone and electricity poles, cables. Ships &amp; fishing boats/nets near the coast also add to the destruction caused by tsunami waves.

## EFFECTS OF TSUNAMI:

Local  tsunami  events  or  those  less  than  30  minutes  from  the  source cause the majority of damage. The force of wave can raze everything in its  path.  It  is  the  flooding  effect  of  a  tsunami,  however,  that  most greatly  affects  human  settlements  by  water  damage  to  homes  and businesses, roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Ships, port facilities, boats/trawlers, fishing nets also get damaged.

There is evidence of ever increasing impact upon the environment on account of the effects of tsunamis. The range varies from generation of tonnes of debris on account of structural collapse of weaker buildings, release of toxic chemicals into the environment on account of chemical leak/spillage/process  failure/utility  breakages/  collateral  hazards  and negative impact on the already fragile ecosystems.

Deaths occur principally from drowning as water inundates homes or neighborhoods. Many people may be washed out to sea or crushed by the giant waves. There may be some injuries from battering by debris and wounds may become contaminated.

Sewer pipes may be damaged causing major sewage disposal problems.

Drinking  water  shortage  arises  due  to  breakage  of  water  mains  and contamination.  Open  wells  and  ground  water  may  become  unfit  for drinking due to contamination of salt water and debris.

Flooding by tsunami causes damage to the standing crops and also to the  food  supplies  in  the  storage  facilities.  The  land  may  be  rendered infertile due to salt water incursion from the sea.

## PREPAREDNESS MEASURES

A hazard map should be prepared with designated areas expected to be damaged  by  flooding  by  tsunami  waves.  Historical  data  could  be  of help  in  showing  areas  inundated  in  the  past.  Keeping  in  mind  the vulnerable areas, evacuation routes should be constructed and mapped. The plan should be followed by evacuation drill.

A  well  networked  system  in  place  can  warn  the  communities  of  the coastal areas when the threat is perceived. Tsunami warning should be disseminated  to  local,  state,  national  as  well  as  the  international community so as to be prepared as they are capable of crossing across continents. The information can be broadcasted to the local emergency officers and the general public. On receiving of the warning the action should be to evacuate the place as decided in the evacuation plan.

Communities in the coastal areas are faced by the wrath of cyclones, storm surge and tsunami waves. It is important that the community is better  prepared  to  take  suitable  actions  on  receiving  the  threat  and follow  emergency  evacuation  plans  and  procedures.  A  community which choose to ignore warning may get severely affected if they are not prepared to take immediate measures.

## MITIGATION STRATEGIES

## Site Planning and Land Management

Within the broader framework of a comprehensive plan, site planning determines the location, configuration, and density of development on particular sites and is, therefore, an important tool in reducing tsunami risk.

- · The  designation  and  zoning  of  tsunami  hazard  areas  for  such open-space  uses  as  agriculture,  parks  and  recreation,  or  natural hazard  areas  is  recommended  as  the  first  land  use  planning strategy.  This  strategy  is  designed  to  keep  development  at  a minimum in hazard areas.
- · In  areas  where  it  is  not  feasible  to  restrict  land  to  open-space uses,  other  land  use  planning  measures  can  be  used.  These include strategically controlling the type of development and uses allowed  in  hazard  areas,  and  avoiding  high-value  and  highoccupancy uses to the greatest degree possible.
- · The capital improvement planning and budgeting process can be used to reinforce land use planning policies.

## Engineering Structures

As most of the structures along the coast area comprises of fisherman community,  which  are  constructed  of  light  weight  materials  without any engineering inputs. Therefore there is an urgent need to educate the community  about  the  good  construction  practices  that  they  should adopt such as:

- · Avoid building or living in buildings within several hundred feet of  the  coastline  as  these  areas  are  more  likely  to  experience damage from tsunamis.
- · Construct the structure on a higher ground level with respect to mean sea level.
- · Elevate  coastal  homes:  Most  tsunami  waves  are  less  than  3 meters  in  height.  Elevating  house  will  help  reduce  damage  to property from  most  tsunamis.  Structural columns  resist the impact while other walls are expendable. It is important also to take  note  that  adequate  measures  are  brought into  the  design  to cater for earthquake forces.
- · Construction of water breakers to reduce the velocity of waves.
- · Use of water &amp; corrosion resistant materials for construction.
- · Construction of community halls at higher locations, which can act as shelters at the time of a disaster.

Flooding  will  result  from  a  tsunami.  Tsunami  waves  will  flood  the coastal areas. Flood mitigation measures could be incorporated. Building barriers or buffers such as special breakwaters or seawalls can be an effective risk reduction measure against gushing waters in case of Tsunami/Storm surge during cyclones.

## CYCLONE HAZARDS AND DISASTERS

## INDIAN CYCLONES

The  coastal  areas  are  subjected  to  severe  wind  storms  and  cyclonic storms. A full-grown cyclone is a violent whirl in the atmosphere 150 to 1000 km across, 10 to 15 km high. Gale winds of 150 to 250 kmph or more spiral around the center of very low pressure area. Torrential rains,  occasional  thunder  and  lightning  flashes  -  join  these  under  an overcast black canopy. Through these churned chaotic sea and atmosphere, the cyclone moves 300 to 500 km, in a day to hit or skirt along a coast, bringing with it storm surges as high as 3 to 12 metres, as if splashing a part of the sea sometimes up to 30 km inland leaving behind death and destructions. A storm surge is the sudden abnormal rise in the sea level caused by cyclone. The sea water flows across the coast as well as inland and then recedes back to the sea. Great loss of life and property takes place in the process.

Cyclones affect both the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. They are rare in Bay of Bengal from January to March. Isolated ones forming in the  South  Bay  of  Bengal  move  west-north-westwards  and  hit  Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka coasts. In April and May, these form in the South and adjoining Central.

Bay  and  move  initially  northwest,  north  and  then  recurve  to  the northeast striking the Arakan coasts in April and Andhra-Orissa-West Bengal-Bangla  desh  coasts  in  May.  Most  of  the  monsoon  (JuneSeptember)  storms  develop  in  the  central  and  in  the  North  Bay  and move west-north-westwards affecting Andhra-Orissa-West Bengal coasts.  Post  monsoon (October-December) storms form mostly in the south and the central Bay, recurve between 15 O and 18 O N affecting 0 0 Tamil Nadu-Andhra Orissa-West Bengal-Bangladesh coasts.

Cyclones  do  not  form  in  Arabian  Sea  during  the  months  of  January, February and March and are rare in April, July, August and September. They  generally  form  in  southeast  Arabian  Sea  and  adjoining  central Arabian Sea in the months of May, October, November and December and  in  east  central  Arabian  Sea  in  the  month  of  June.  Some  of  the cyclones that originate in the Bay of Bengal travel across the peninsula weaken and emerge into Arabian Sea as low pressure areas. These may again intensify into cyclonic storms. Most of the storms in Arabian Sea move  in  west-north-westerly  direction  towards  Arabian  Coast  in  the month of May and in a northerly direction towards Gujarat Coast in the month of June. In other months, they generally move northwest north and then recurve northeast affecting Gujarat-Maharashtra coasts; a few, however, also move west north westwards towards Arabian coast.(Table-5.1)

## HAZARD ZONES

The wind zone map illustrates the area vulnerable to high wind speeds. The macro-level wind speed zones of India have been formulated and published in  IS  875  (Part-3)  -  1987.  There  are  six  basic  wind  speeds  considered for zoning, namely:

<!-- image -->

The criteria followed by the Meteorological Department of India to classify the  low  pressure  systems  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal  and  in  the  Arabian  Sea  as adopted  by  the  World  Meteorological  Organisation  (WMO)  is  shown  in Box:

## Wind Circulation and Disturbances

Types of Disturbances Associated wind speed in the Circulation

|                               | Knot                | Km/hr              |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 1. Low Pressure Area          | Less than 17 knots  | &lt; 31 kmph          |
| 2. Depression                 | 17 to 27 knots      | 31 to 49 kmph      |
| 3. Deep Depression            | 28 to 33 knots      | 50 to 61 kmph      |
| 4. Cyclonic Storm             | 34 to 47 knots      | 62 to 88 kmph      |
| 5. Severe Cyclonic Storm      | 48 to 63 knots      | 89 to 118 kmph     |
| 6. Very Severe Cyclonic Storm | 64 to 119 knots     | 119 to 221 kmph    |
| 7. Super Cyclonic Storm       | 120 knots and above | 222 kmph and above |

| Level of Risks               | Wind Speed  (km/hr)   |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Very High Damage Risk Zone-A | 198                   |
| Very High Damage Risk Zone-B | 180 km/hr             |
| High Damage Risk Zone        | 169.2 km/hr           |
| Moderate Damage Risk Zone-A  | 158.4 km/hr           |
| Moderate Damage Risk Zone-B  | 140.4 km/hr           |
| Low Damage Risk Zone         | 118.8 km/hr           |

The  cyclone  affected  areas  of  the  country  are  classified  in  50  and  55m/s zones. It is known that in certain events, the wind gusts could appreciably

exceed the given basic wind speeds. For design of structures and classification  of  vulnerability  and  risk  to  buildings,  the  above  macro-level zoning is considered as sufficient.

## Surge Prone Coasts of India

Storm surge heights depend on the intensity of the cyclone, i.e., very highpressure gradient and consequent very strong winds and the topography of seabed near the point where a cyclone crosses the coast. Sea level also rises due to astronomical high tide. Elevation of the total sea level increases when peak surge occurs at the time of high tide. Vulnerability to storm surges is not uniform along Indian coasts.

The following segments of the East Coast of India are most vulnerable to high surges:

- · North Orissa and West Bengal coasts.
- · Andhra Pradesh coast between Ongole and Machilipatnam.
- · Tamil Nadu coast, south of Nagapatnam.

The West  Coast  of  India is  less  vulnerable  to  storm  surges  than  the  east coast of India in terms of both the height of storm surge as well as frequency of occurrence. However, the following segments are vulnerable to significant surges:

- · Maharashtra coast, north of Harnai and adjoining south Gujarat coast and the coastal belt around the Gulf of Bombay.
- · The coastal belt around the Gulf of Kutch.

The coastal belt plantation (green belt plantation along the coastal line in a scientific interweaving pattern) can reduce the adverse impact of hazards of cyclone, tsunami, and flood.  However, the frequent cutting of plants, trees and clearance of forest and mangroves, the cyclone and tsunami waves trend freely  in  land. The  lakh  of  productive  forest  cover  allows  water  to immediate  large  areas  and  cause  destruction.    Thus,  community  based mitigation strategies are to be introduced.

## VULNERABILITY

All lightweight structures and those built of mud, wood, older buildings with  weak  walls  and  structures  without  proper  anchorage  to  the foundations  will  be  at  great  risk.  Settlements  located  in  low  lying coastal  areas  will  be  vulnerable  to  the  direct  effects  of  the  cyclones such as wind, rain and storm surge. Settlements in adjacent areas will be  vulnerable  to  floods,  mudslides  or  landslides  due  to  heavy  rains. Other elements at risk are fences, telephone &amp; electricity poles, cables, light elements  of structures-roofs, signboards, hoardings, coconut crowns, fishing boats &amp; large trees.

## EFFECTS OF CYCLONE HAZARD

First, in a sudden, brief onslaught, high winds cause major damage to infrastructure and housing, in particular fragile constructions. They are generally followed by heavy rains and floods and, in flat coastal areas by storm surge riding on tidal waves and inundating the land over long

distances  of  even  up  to  15km  inland.    Structures  will  be  damaged  or destroyed by the wind force, flooding and storm surge. Light pitched roofs  of  most  structures  especially  the  ones  fitted  on  to  industrial buildings  will  suffer  severe  damage.    Caused  by  flooding  and  flying elements, contamination of water supplies may lead to viral outbreaks, diarrhea,  and  malaria.    Ground  and  piped  water  supply  may  get contaminated  by  flood  waters.    High  winds  and  rains  will  ruin  the standing crop and food stock lying in low lying areas. Plantation type crops such as banana and coconut are extremely vulnerable. Salt from the sea water may be deposited on the agricultural land and increase the salinity. The loss of the crop may lead to acute food shortage.

Severe  disruption  in  the  communication  links  as  the  wind  may  bring down the electricity and communication towers, electricity and telephone poles, telephone lines, antennas and satellite disk and broadcasting services. Transport lines (road and rail) may be curtailed. Relief materials may not reach the affected site.

## MITIGATION STRATEGIES

Meteorological  records  of  the  wind  speed  and  the  directions  give  the probability  of  the  winds  in  the  region.  Cyclones  can  be  predicted  several days  in  advance.  The  onset  is  extensive  and  often  very  destructive.  Past records  and  paths  can  give  the  pattern  of  occurrence  for  particular  wind speeds. A hazard map will illustrate the areas vulnerable to the cyclone in any given year. It will be useful to estimate the severity of the cyclone and various  damage  intensities  in  the  region.  The  map  is  prepared  with  data

inputs  of  past  climatological  records,  history  of  wind  speed,  frequency  of flooding etc.

Land use control should be designed so that least critical activities are placed in vulnerable areas. Location of settlements in the flood plains is at utmost risk. Setting of key facilities must be marked in the land use. Policies should be  in  place  to regulate  land  use  and  enforcement  of  building  codes. Vulnerable areas should be kept for parks, grazing or play grounds.

Engineered structures need to be built to withstand wind forces. Good site selection  is  also  important.  Majority  of  the  buildings  in  coastal  areas  are built with locally available materials and have no engineering inputs. Good construction practice should be adopted such as:

- -Cyclonic  wind  storms  inundate  the  coastal  areas.  It  is  advised  to construct on stilts or on earth mound.
- -Houses  can  be  strengthened  to  resist  wind  and  flood  damage.  All elements holding the structures need to be properly anchored to resist the uplift or flying off of the objects.
- -A row of planted trees will act as a shield. It reduces the energy.
- -Buildings should be wind and water resistant.
- -Buildings storing food supplies must be protected against the winds and water.
- -Protect river embankments. Communication lines should be installed underground.
- -Provide strong halls for community shelter in vulnerable locations.

Flooding  will  result  from  a  cyclonic  storm.  Storm  surge  will  flood  the coastal areas. Heavy rains will bring in flash floods. There are possibilities of landslides too. Flood mitigation measures could be incorporated.

Improving vegetation cover - improvement of the vegetation will increase water infiltration capacity of the soil. The roots of the plants and trees will keep the soil intact and prevent erosion and slow runoff to prevent or lessen flooding. The use of tree planted in rows will act as a windbreak.

Coastal  shelterbelt  plantation can  be  developed  to  break  severe  wind speeds.  It  minimizes  devastating  effects.  The  Orissa  calamity  has  also highlighted  the  need  for  urgent  measures  like  shelterbelt  plantation  along cyclone-prone coastal areas. Species chosen for this purpose should not only be able to withstand the impact of strong cyclonic winds, but also check soil erosion.

## Chapter-6

## FLOOD

Floods are a recurring phenomenon in chronically flood prone regions in India.  Floods affect around 7.56 million hectares of area (2.30 per cent of country's area) and 3.3 million hectares of crop lands every year (4 per cent of the cropped area).  Eastern India, comprising Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal,  Assam,  and  Orissa  account  for  about  70  per  cent  of  the  flood impacts in the country.  The death toll due to major floods in India is shown in Table-6.1

The flood of 2000 alone killed about 1300 persons in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh,  Assam,  Arunachal  Pradesh,  Bihar,  Himachal  Pradesh,  Kerala, Madhya  Pradesh,  Punjab,  Uttar  Pradesh  and  West  Bengal.    Even,  floods have  adversely  affected  economy  and  society  of  major  metropolitan  cities like  Mumbai, Surat, Ahmadabad, Raipur, and Pune etc. in the recent past. The flood of Bihar in 2008 has adversely affected about 3 million peoples of the  state.  The  annual  damage  due  to  heavy  rains  landslides  and  floods  is shown in Table - 6.2.

In 2001, 122 districts were hit by floods and affected 21.110 million population.  Mapping of flood prone areas; land use regulation and control; construction  of  engineered  structures;  flood  management;  and  community based  mitigation  such  as  sedimentation  clearance,  reforestation,  etc.  may reduce the adverse impact of floods in vulnerable areas.

## Vulnerability of Floods

Anything  in  the  flood  plains  will  get  inundated.  Buildings  built  of earth, weak foundations and water soluble materials will collapse

endangering humans and their property.  Basements of buildings are under risk.  Utilities  such  as  sewerage,  water  supply,  communication  lines,  and power  are  put  at  risk.  Food  stock  in  the  godowns,  agricultural  fields,  salt pans, livestock, vehicles, machinery and equipments mounted on the ground, fishing boats are also put at risk.

## Hazard Zones

The Vulnerability Atlas of India shows pictorially the areas liable to floods. The flood hazard map is based on the Flood Atlas of India brought out  by  the  Central  Water  Commission,  state  wise  marking  both  the  areas which are liable to flooding as well as those which have been protected. The maps given in the Vulnerability Atlas of India show the district boundaries and  the  location  of  the  district  towns  along  with  the  rivers  district  wise identification  of  vulnerable  areas  will  be  easy.  Besides  the  problems  of flooding in the river plains, heavy intensity rains could cause local; flooding in certain areas where the drainage is either naturally poor or the drains are choked  due  to  various  reasons  such  as  careless  dumping  of  refuse  in  the drains and lack of maintenance. Much of the flooding in the towns and cities occur due to such cases. Under cyclonic winds in coastal areas, the sea coast of India can be flooded due to heavy down pour on the one hand and storm surge on the other. The depth of inland water inundation could be worked out  by  taking  the  storm  surge  heights.  The  rivers  in  India  can  be  broadly divided into the following four regions for a study of flood problem.

- 1. Brahmaputra Region;
- 2. Ganga Region;
- 3. North West Region; and

## Causes of Floods

Flooding is caused by the inadequate capacity within the banks of the rivers  to  contain  the  high  flows  brought  down  from  the  upper  catchments due to heavy rainfall. Areas having poor drainage characteristic get flooded by  accumulation  of  water  from  heavy  rainfall.  Flooding  is  accentuated  by erosion  and  silting  of  the  river  beds  resulting  in  reduction  of  carrying capacity of river channel. earthquakes and landslides leading to changes in river courses, obstructions to flow, synchronization of floods in the main and tributary rivers and retardation due to tidal effects. Some parts of the country

mainly  coastal  areas  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Assam,  Orissa,  Tamilnadu  and West  Bengal  experience  cyclones  which  often  are  accompanied  by  heavy rainfall leading to flooding.

Another cause for flooding has been the water logging in the irrigated area.  This  is  due  to  excess  irrigation  water  applied  to  command  area  and increase in ground water level due to seepage from canals and irrigated field. It has been assessed that an area of 2.46 m. ha. is suffering from problem of water logging under irrigation commands in India.

## Effects of Flood

Physical  DamagThe  structures  may  damage  or  collapse  by  washing waters, landslide triggering on account of water getting saturated. Boats and fishing  equipments  may  be  lost  or  damaged  in  coastal  areas.    People  and livestock  deaths  may  be  caused  by  drowning,  very  few  serious  injuries. Outbreak  of  epidemics,  diarrhea,  viral  infections,  malaria  may  also  be happened.    Contamination  of  water  (wells,  ground  water,  piped  water supply)  is  very  common  during  floods.  Clean  water  may  be  unavailable. Sudden food shortage can be caused due to loss of entire harvest, spoiling of grains when saturated in water along with loss of animal fodder. The crop storage facilities and go-downs may get submerged resulting in immediate food shortage. Floods may also affect the soil characteristics. The land may be  rendered  infertile  due  to  erosion  of  top  layer  or  may  turn  saline  if  sea water floods the area.

Embankments along the rivers, sea walls along the coasts may keep water  away  from  the  flood  plains.  Water  flow  can  be  regularized  through

construction of the reservoirs, check dams, alternate drainage channels/routes, increasing vegetation cover and by providing storm drains.

## Mitigation Strategies

Mapping  of  the  flood  prone  areas is  a  primary  step  involved  in reducing the risk of the region. Historical records give the indication of the flood  inundation  areas  and  the  period  of  occurrence  and  the  extent  of  the coverage. The basic map is combined with other maps and data to form a complete image of the floodplain. Warning can be issued looking into the earlier marked heights of the water levels in case of potential threat. In the coastal areas the tide levels and the land characteristics will determine the submergence areas. Flood hazard mapping will give the proper indication of water flow during floods.

Land use control will reduce danger of life and property when waters inundate the floodplains and the coastal areas. The number of casualties is related to the population in the area at risk. It's better to reduce the densities in  areas  where  neighborhoods  are  to  be  developed.  In  areas  where  people already have built their settlements, measures should be taken to relocate to better sites so as to reduce vulnerability. No major development should be permitted  in  the  areas  which  are  subjected  to  high  flooding.  Important facilities  should  be  built  in  safe  areas.  In  urban  areas,  water  holding  areas can be created in ponds, lakes or low-lying areas. Construction of engineered structures in  the  flood  plains  and  strengthening  of  structures  to  withstand flood forces and seepage is imperative. The buildings should be constructed on a elevated area. If necessary build on stilts or platform.

Flood  Control aims  to  reduce  flood  damage.  This  can  be  done  by Flood  Reduction by  decreasing  the  amount  of  runoff  by  treatment  like reforestation  protection  of  vegetation,  clearing  of  debris  from  streams  and other  water  holding  areas,  conservation  of  ponds  and  lakes  etc. Flood Diversion include  levees,  embankments,  dams  and  channel  improvement. Dams can store water and can release water at a manageable rate. But failure of dams in earthquakes and operation of releasing the water can cause floods in  the  lower  areas. Flood  Proofing reduces  the  risk  of  damage.  Measures include use of sand bags to keep flood water away, blocking or sealing of doors and windows of houses etc. Houses may be elevated by building on raised land. Buildings should be constructed away from water bodies.

Flood Management in India, was initiated by systematic planning for flood management commenced with the Five Year Plans, particularly with the launching of National Programme of Flood Management in 1954. During the last 48 years, different methods of flood protection structural as well as non-structural  have  been  adopted  in  different  states  depending  upon  the nature  of  the  problem  and  local  conditions.  Structural  measures  include storage reservoirs, flood embankments,  drainage  channels,  anti-erosion works, channel improvement works, detention basins etc. and non-structural measures  include  flood  forecasting,  flood  plain  zoning,  flood  proofing, disaster  preparedness  etc.  The  flood  management  measures  undertaken  so far have provided reasonable degree of protection to an area of 15.81 million hectares through out the country. The various flood management measures undertaken  through  the  successive  five  year  plans  (up  to  3/2000)  are summarized below:

## Approaches, Policies and Measures

The  approaches  to  deal  with  Floods  may  be  any  one  or  more combination of the following available options:

- (i) Attempts to modify the food.
- (ii) Attempts to modify the susceptibility to flood.
- (iii) Attempts to modify the loss burden.
- (iv) Bearing the loss.

## Evolution of Policies on Flood Management in India

After the unprecedented floods of 1954, the Government of India took several  initiatives  and  constituted  a  number  of  Committees  to  study  the problem of floods in the country. The important steps are,

- · Policies Statement- 1954
- · High Level Committee on Floods-1957
- · Policy Statement of 1958.
- · Ministerial Committee on Flood Control-1964.
- · Minister's Committee on Flood Control for Five Year Plans.
- · Rashtriya Barh Ayog (RBA) - 1980
- · National Water Policy (1987).
- · National  Commission  for  Integrated  Water  Resource  Development Plan-1996.
- · Regional Task Forces-1996.
- · National Water Policy (2002).

All the measures for flood management can be classified as under:

## Structural measures

- (i) Embankments, flood walls, sea wall.
- (ii) Dams and Reservoirs.
- (iii) Natural detention basin.
- (iv) Channel improvement.
- (v) Drainage improvement.
- (vi) Diversion of flood waters.

## Non-structural measures

- (i) Flood Plain Zoning
- (ii) Flood Proofing including Disaster Preparedness and Response Planning.
- (iii) Flood Forecasting and Warning.
- (iv) Disaster Relief.
- (v) Flood Fighting including Public Health Measures.
- (vi) Flood Insurance

## Chapter- 7 DROUGHT

Drought is an insidious natural hazard that results from a departure of precipitation  from  expected  or  normal  that  is  insufficient  to  meet  the demands of human, plant and animal activities.  Almost 35 per cent of the country's  area,  receiving  annual  average  rainfall  of  less  than  750  mm  is prone  to  drought  once  in  three  years.    In  these  areas,  almost  200  million people are affected in varying degrees by drought (Table - 7.1). In the arid and  the  semi  arid  regions,  seasonal  periodicities  can  affect  the  pattern  of livelihood system of farmers.

## Causes of Droughts

Inadequate and improper management  of  rainfall are the most important factors causing drought. Denuded and sloppy landscapes result in

colossal  loss  of  soil  and  washes  away  soil  nutrients,  which  are  scarce  in drought prone areas creating nutrient stressed conditions. Studies at Solapur in run off plots put the loss of 60-90 tones of soil from one hectare each year due to  erosion  resulting  from  different  management  practices.  Proper  land treatment for retention of rain water is a part of drought proofing. Division of land amongst family members and extending cultivation to the marginal and sub marginal areas destroys the natural grass cover resulting in erosion and  thereby  poor  production.  Fragmentation  of  land,  unchecked  cattle population, destruction of grass lands and trees accelerate the land degradation and also encourage soil erosion.

## Consequences of Droughts

Indian  economy  being  agriculture  oriented  any  adversely  effect  on agriculture affects the economy badly. The major kharif crops are rain water dependent and depending upon the rain water crops face stress in different parts  of  country.  In  addition  to  poor  crop  production  and  reduced  water availability,  drought  affects  rural  life  in  several  ways.  Drought  results  in large scale unemployment of the rural population, who migrate to urban and industrially advanced areas, in search of livelihood. This creates large scale problems of environmental pollution and social crimes in cities. A long term objective to manage drought is, therefore, to provide alternate employment in  rural  areas.  We  should  include  agro-based  industries  in  thrust  areas  for employment  of  the  rural  population.  Poultry  farms,  dairy  industries,  silk worm rearing and handicrafts should be encouraged by various incentives.

## Peculiarities of Droughts

Drought has always been listed as a principle-limiting factor for the productivity of the land. The World's climate patterns are so made that the smaller the level of precipitation the larger is the variability. It is not only a question  of  water  shortage  but  also  a problem  of  uncertainty  in  the availability of water. Stability of production is finally dependent on stability in water. In Bihar (a high rainfall area) the coefficient of variation is 13-14 percent, whereas in drought prone areas it could be as high as 32 percent. Drought  prone  areas  will  have  to  make  special  efforts  to  overcome  their natural  handicap  on  account  of  shortage  of  water  and  also  on  account  of uncertainties in the availability of their share of scarce water.

## Elements at Risk

Drought impacts mostly rain fed crops to start with and subsequently the  irrigated  crops.  Areas  with  minimum  of  alternative  water  sources  to rainfall (ground  and  canal  water  supplies),  areas subjected  to drastic environmental degradation such as denuded forest lands and altered ecosystems, and areas where livelihoods alternative to agriculture are least developed are most vulnerable to drought. The herdsman, landless laborers, subsistence  farmers,  the  women,  children,  and  farm  animals  are  the  most vulnerable groups affected by the drought conditions.

## Effects of Droughts

Drought,  different  from  other  natural  disasters,  do  not  cause  any structural  damages.  The  typical  effects  include  loss  of  crop,  dairy,  timber (forest fires), and  fishery production; increase in energy  demand  for

pumping water; reduced energy production; increased unemployment, loss of  biodiversity,  reduced  water,  air,  and  landscape  quality;  groundwater depletion, food shortage, health reduction and loss of life, increased poverty, reduced quality of life, and social unrest leading to migration.

## Mitigation Strategies

Drought monitoring is continuous observation of rainfall situation,  water  availability  in  reservoirs,  lakes,  rivers  and  comparing with the existing water needs of various sectors of the society.

Water  supply  augmentation  and  conservation through  rainwater harvesting in houses and farmers' fields increases the content of water available. Expansion of irrigation facilities reduces the drought vulnerability. Land use based on its capability helps in optimum use of land  and  water  and  can  avoid  the  undue  demand  created  due  to  their misuse.

Livelihood  planning identifies  those  livelihoods  which  are  least affected  by  the  drought.  Some  of  such  livelihoods  include  increased off-farm  employment  opportunities,  collection  of  non-timber  forest produce from the community forests, raising goats, and carpentry etc.

## Drought Planning

The basic goal of drought planning is to improve the effectiveness of preparedness and response efforts by enhancing monitoring, mitigation and response measures. Planning would help in

effective  coordination  among  state  and  national  agencies  in  dealing with  the  drought.  Components  of  drought  plan  include  establishing drought  taskforce  which  is  a  team  of  specialists  who  can  advise  the government in taking decision to deal with drought situation, establishing  coordination  mechanism  among  various  agencies  which deal  with  the  droughts,  providing  crop  insurance  schemes  to  the farmers  to  cope  with  the  drought  related  crop  losses,  and  public awareness generation.

## Public Awareness and Education

Educating the masses on various strategies would  help in effective drought mitigation. This includes organizing drought information  meetings  for  the  public  and  media,  implementing  water conservation  awareness  programs  in  the  mass  media  like  television, publishing and distributing pamphlets on water conservation techniques and agricultural drought management strategies like crop contingency plans  and  rainwater  harvesting  and  establishing  drought  information centers for easy access to the farmers.

## Watersheds

Watersheds  are  the  geographic  areas  where  the  water  flows  to  a common point. To mitigate the drought impact, all kinds of soil and water conservation  measures  are  taken  up  with  the  involvement  of  the  local communities.  This  approach  helped  these  areas  to  manage  efficiently  the soil,  vegetation,  water  and  other  resources.  By  conserving  scarce  water

sources and improving the management of soil and vegetation, watersheds have  the  potential  to  create  conditions  conducive  to  higher  agricultural productivity while conserving natural resources.

## Check dams

These  are  check  dams  or  diversion  weirs  built  across  rivers.  A traditional system found in Maharashtra, their presence raises the water level of the rivers so that it begins to flow into channels. They are also used to impound  water  and  form  a  large  reservoir.  Where  a  bandhara  was  built across a small stream, the water supply would usually last for a few months after the rains .

Following measures are suggested to mitigate drought consequences:

- (a) Supply-Oriented Measures are intended to increase the available water supply during drought through:-
- · Maximizing surface water storage capacity.
- · Maximizing ground water storage capacity.
- · Water  transfer  between  river  basins  or  within  the  same  river basin.
- · Evaporation and evapotranspiration suppression.
- · Reduction of infiltration losses
- · Soil conservation practices.
- · Utilization of inferior quality water.
- · Relaxation of water quality standards
- · Increasing ground water use
- · weather modification

- · Interception of dew and fog
- · Long distance transfer of water
- · Regional interconnection of water supply networks.
- · Water transportation by vehicles or boats
- · Desalination of salt or blackish waters
- (b) Demand-Oriented  Measures  are intended to decrease the water demand during drought through:-
- · Appeals to consumers to reduce water use
- · Water reuse
- · Restrictions on water use
- · Adjustment of patterns of water consumption by users
- · Economic incentives for reducing water consumption
- · Regional and local support for water demand reducing strategies.
- (c) Impact-Minimization  Measures  are  intended  to  minimize  drought impacts  occurring  in  spite  of  increased  water  supply  and  decrease demands through:-
- · Drought forecast
- · Drought warnings
- · Drought insurance
- · Disaster aid programmes

## Comprehensive Monitoring

Based on the use feedback and their requirements, a comprehensive national drought monitoring system is under implementation. The enhanced system may include:-

- (i) Near real-time drought monitoring with biweekly bulletins disseminated within a week.
- (ii) Coverage of both kharif and rabi seasons.
- (iii) Coverage of 12 drought vulnerable and agriculturally important States (Andhra  Pradesh,  Gujarat,  Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  Orissa,  Tamil Nadu,  Haryana,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Rajasthan,  Uttar  Pradesh,  West Bengal and Bihar).
- (iv) Cover  meteorological,  hydrologic,  agricultural  and  socio  economic drought indicators and impacts.
- (v) Technology intensification for near real-time sub-district level monitoring with use of new sensor data and analysis techniques.

## Chapter-8 LANDSLIDE

Landslide  constitute  a  major  natural  hazard  in  our  country,  which accounts for considerable loss of life and damage to communication routes, human settlements, agricultural fields and forest lands. The Indian subcontinent, with diverse physiographic, seism tectonic and climatological conditions is subjected to varying degree of landslide hazards; the Himalayas including Northeastern mountains ranges being the worst affected, followed  by  a  section  of  Western  Ghats  and  the  Vindhyas. Removal of vegetation and toe erosion have also triggered slides Torrential monsoon on the vegetation  cover  removed  slopes  was  the  main  causative factors in the Peninsular India namely in Western Ghat and Nilgiris. Human intervention  by  way  of  slope  modification  has  added  to  this  effect  Major landslides are shown in Table 8.1

## Hazard Zones

The  Landslide  map  needs  to  be  popularized  among  the  architects, engineers and development planners and also to the public so that it is used as a tool for regulating construction or development activities and means of managing or mitigating landslide disasters.

## Zone Significance of Landslides

The four point hazard scales of the Landslide Zones are - (1) Severe to Very High, (2) High, (3) Moderate to low, (4) Unlikely, was considered adequate. The zonal significance is given below:

## (1) Severe to Very High

The  area  is  well  known  for  the  danger  of  landslides,  and  for  the perennial  threat  to  life  and  property.  Restrictions  on  all  new  constructions and adoption of improved land use and management practices deserve to be encouraged.  Investments  on  landslide  remediation  measures,  on  public education and on early warning systems are strongly indicated.

## (2) High

This is a zone in which landslides have occurred in the past and are already to be expected in the future. New constructions in this zone should be strictly regulated and construction should be done only after proper site investigation  and  implementation  of  appropriate  remedial  package.  Before the new construction projects are cleared in this zone, environment impact assessment should be made mandatory.

## (3) Moderate to Low

Engineered  and  well-regulated  new  construction  activities  and  wellplanned agricultural practices could be permitted. All construction activities should  however  be  based  on  technically  evaluated  and  certified  plans  by established institutions and authorized consultants.

## (4) Unlikely

No visible sign of slope instability are seen in this zone in the present stage of knowledge. No blanket restriction needs to be imposed on various land use practices provided they confirm to the prevailing building regulations and bye-laws. Location specific limitations may become necessary for high-density urban areas. Snow covered areas

## Onset Type and Warning

Though  they  occur  gradually,  however  sudden  failure  (sliding)  can occur without warning. They may take place in combination with earthquakes, floods and volcanoes. There are no clearly established warnings in place indicating occurrence of landslide and hence difficult to predict the

actual occurrence. Areas  of high risk can be determined  by  use  of information  on  geology,  hydrology,  vegetation  cover,  past  occurrence  and consequences in the region.

## Causes of Landslides

Geological  weak  material weathered  materials,  jointed  or  fissured materials,  contrast  in  permeability  and  contrast  in  stiffness  (stiff,  dense material over plastic materials) may cause landslides.

Wave erosion of slope toe, glacial erosion of slope toe, subterranean erosion  Deposition  loading  slope  or  its  crest,  vegetation  removal  etc  also cause landslides.

Storms  that  produce  intense  rainfall  for  periods  as  short  as  several hours or have a more moderate intensity lasting several days have triggered abundant  landslides.    Human  excavation of  slope and  its  toe,  loading  of slope/toe, draw down in reservoir, mining, deforestation, irrigation, vibration/blast, water  leakage  from  services  may  result  in  landsliding. Earthquake shaking has triggered landslides in many different topographic and geologic settings. Rock falls, soil slides and rockslides from steep slopes involving  relatively  thin  or  shallow  dis-aggregated  soils  or  rock,  or  both have  been  the  most  abundant  types  of  landslides  triggered  by  historical earthquakes.    Deposition  of  loose  volcanic  ash  on  hillsides  commonly  is followed by accelerated erosion and frequent mud or debris flows triggered by intense rainfall.

## Elements at Risk

The  most  common  elements  at  risk  are  the  settlements  built  on  the steep  slopes,  built  at  the  toe  and  those  built  at  the  mouth  of  the  streams emerging from the mountain valley. All those buildings constructed without appropriate foundation for a given soil and in sloppy areas are also at risk. Roads, communication line and buried utilities are vulnerable.

The damage intensity related of landslides is shown in chart-8.1

Chart-8.1 Damage Intensity of Landslides

|   Damage  classification | Damage level   | Movement  Rate   | Typical Effect on Roadway and Related  Activities                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                        1 | Imperceptible  | Extremely slow   | Routine and periodic maintenance, Movement  cannot be detected without instruments.                                                                                  |
|                        2 | Negligible     | Very slow        | Maintenance  keeps  road  open  with  only  infrequent  road  closures;  drainage  structures  generally  not  damaged.  Repair  work  is  generally not urgent.     |
|                        3 | Slight         | Slow             | Road closures probable for short time periods.  Repair  work  can  be  safely  done  during  movement.                                                               |
|                        4 | Moderate       | Moderate         | Overall  roadway  stability  may  be  affected  unless  remedial  work  is  undertaken  immediately.  Worker  safety  must  be  monitored.                           |
|                        5 | Serious        | Rapid            | Roadways  are  closed  and  immediate  areas  evacuated.  Unsafe  to  undertake  remedial  work while movement continues.                                            |
|                        6 | Very serious   | Very Rapid       | Roadway  destroyed.  Escape  difficult  for  motorists  and  pedestrians.  Repair  questionable.                                                                     |
|                        7 | Catastro-phic  | Extremely  Rapid | Total  destruction  of  roadway  and  adjoining  areas.  Escape  unlikely  for  motorists,  pedestrians, structures and inhabitants. Repair  possibilities unlikely. |

## Effects of Landslides

Landslides destroy anything that comes in their path. They block or bury  roads,  lines  of  communication,  settlements,  river  flow,  agricultural land,  etc.  It  also  includes  loss  to  agricultural  production  and  land  area.  In addition  physical  effects  such  as  flooding  may  also  occur.  They  cause maximum  fatalities depending  on  the place and time of occurrence. Catastrophic landsides have killed many thousands of persons, such as the debris slide on the slopes of Huascaran in Peru triggered by an earthquake in 1970, which killed over 18,000 people.

## Mitigation Strategies

Hazard  mapping will  locate  areas  prone  to  slope  failures.  This  will permit to identify avoidance of areas for building settlements. These maps will serve as a tool for mitigation planning.

Proper land use practices  may  mitigated the landsliding.    The  land  use practices are discussed below:

- · Areas covered by degraded natural vegetation in upper slopes are to be afforested with suitable species. Existing patches of natural vegetation (forest and natural grass land) in good condition should be preserved.
- · Any developmental activity  initiated  in  the  area  should  be  taken  up only after a detailed study of the region and slope protection should be carried out if necessary.
- · In  construction  of  roads,  irrigation  canals  etc.  proper  care  is  to  be taken to avoid blockage of natural drainage

- · Total  avoidance  of  settlement  in  the  risk  zone  should  be  made mandatory.
- · Relocate settlements and infrastructure that fall in the possible path of the landslide
- · No construction of buildings in areas beyond a certain degree of slope.

Retaining Walls can be built to stop land from slipping. It's constructed  to  prevent  smaller  sized  and  secondary  landslides  that  often occur  along  the  toe  portion  of  the  larger  landslides.  The  surface  drainage control  works  are  implemented  to  control  the  movement  of  landslides accompanied  by  infiltration  of  rain  water  and  spring  flows.  Engineered structures with strong foundations can withstand or take the ground movement forces. Underground installations (pipes, cables, etc.) should be made flexible to move in order to withstand forces caused by the landslide.

Increasing vegetation cover is the cheapest and most effective way of arresting landslides. This helps to bind the top layer of the soil with layers below, while preventing excessive run-off and soil  erosion.  Insurance  will assist individuals whose homes are likely to be damaged by landslides or by any other natural hazards. For new constructions it should include standards for selection of the site as well as construction technique.

## Landslide and Debris Flow

Landslides  are  a  serious  geologic  hazard  very  common  in  northern part  of  India.  Globally,  landslides  cause  billions  of  dollars  in  damage  and thousands of deaths and injuries each year.

## (i) How to Protect Property

- (a) If  your  property  is  in  a  landslide-prone  area,  contract  with  a consulting company specializing in earth movement for opinions and  advice  on  landslides  problems  and  on  corrective  measures you can take. Such companies would likely be those specializing in  geotechnical  or  structural  engineering.  Taking  steps  without consulting a professional could make your situation worse.
- (b) Install flexible pipe fittings to avoid gas or water leaks. Flexible fittings will be less likely to break.

## (ii) What to Do Before Intense Storms

- (a) Become familiar with the land around. Learn whether landslides and  debris  flows  have  occurred  in  the  area  by  contacting  local officials. Knowing the land can help to assess the risk for danger.
- (b) Watch  the  patterns  of  storm-water  drainage  on  slopes  near  to home,  and  especially  the  places  where  runoff  water  converges, increasing  flow  over  soil-covered  slopes.  Watch  the  hillsides around the home for any signs of land movement, such as small landslides or debris flows, or progressively tilting trees. Watching small changes could alert to the potential of a greater landslide threat.

## (iii) What to Do During Intense Storms

- (a) Stay  alert  and  awake.  Many  debris-flow  fatalities  occur  when people are sleeping. Listen to a Radio or television for warnings of intense rainfall. Be aware that intense, short bursts of rain may

be  particularly  dangerous,  especially  after  longer  periods  of heavy rainfall and damp weather.

- (b) If  one  is  in  areas  susceptible  to  landslides  and  debris  flows, consider  leaving  if  it  is  safe  to  do  so.  Remember  that  driving during  an  intense  storm  can  be  hazardous.  If  one  remains  at home, move to a second story. If possible. Staying out of the path of a landslide or debris flow saves lives.
- (c) Listen for any unusual sounds that might indicate moving debris, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together. A trickle of flowing or falling mud or debris may precede larger landslides. Moving debris can flow quickly and sometimes without warning.
- (d) If  someone is near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow and for a change from clear to muddy  water.  Such  changes  may  indicate  landslide  activity upstream,  so  be  prepared  to  move  quickly.  Don't  delay!  Save oneself, not the belongings.
- (e) Be especially alert when driving. Embankments along roadsides are  particularly  susceptible  to  landslides.  Watch  the  road  for collapsed pavement, mud, fallen rocks, and other indications of possible debris flows.

## (iv) What to Do If Suspect Imminent Landslide Danger

- (a) Contact  local  fire,  police,  or  public  works  department.  Local officials are the best persons able to assess potential danger.
- (b) Inform affected neighbors. The neighbors  may not be aware of potential  hazards.  Advising them of a potential threat may help save lives. Help neighbors who may need assistance to evacuate.

- (c) Evacuate. Getting out of the path of a landslide or debris flow is the best protection.

## (v) What to Do During a Landslide

- (a) Quickly  move  out  of  the  path  of  the  landslide  or  debris  flow. Moving  away  from  the  path  of  the  flow  to  a  stable  area  will reduce the risk.
- (b) If  escape  is  not  possible,  curl  into  a  tight  ball  and  protect  the head. A tight ball will provide the best protection for the body.

## (vi) What to Do After a Landslide

- (a) Stay away from the slide area. There may be danger of additional slides.
- (b) Check  for  injured  and  trapped  persons  near  the  slide,  without entering the direct slide area. Direct rescuers to their locations.

## HUMAN INDUCED DISASTERS

In a society where gender, caste, religion, region, and class differentials are extremely predominated human made disasters tend to  occur  more  frequently  and  often  with  great  intensity.  Communal  riots, terrorism, militancy, ethnic conflicts, plight of refugees, internally displaced persons,  road  and  train  accidents,  forest  and  buildings  fire,  epidemics  and industrial accidents etc. cause heavy toll of human lives and property. The natural disasters cannot be properly predicted and controlled while manmade disasters may be controlled through proper planning and preparedness.

Forest fires are a major cause of degradation of India's forests. About 90 per cent of the forest fires in India are created by humans. India witnessed the  most  severe  forest  fire  in  during  the  summer  of  1945  in  the  hills  of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. The fires were very severe and attracted the attention of whole nation. These affected 6.78 million hectares of forest land. About 3.75 million hectares of forests are affected by fire annually, as per Forest Protection Division, Ministry  of Forests and  Environment, Government of India.

Fires in Urban Structure - houses, buildings, and other structure also cause  destruction  to  property  and  human  lives.  Heating  sources,  cooking accidents, electric short, combustible and hazardous materials etc. cause the fire in urban  structures. In the event  of fires, chemical  leakages,  or explosions occurring in industrial facilities, people are exposed to risks and hazards.  Bhopal chemical gas leak disaster (1984) was the worst industrial

disasters of India.  The tragedy was a technological accident in which highly poisonous  methyl  iso-cyanide  gas  along  with  hydrogen  cyanide  and  other reaction products leaked out of the pesticide factory of Union Carbide into the night air of Bhopal. The official death toll reached to 3,598 in 1989 and thousands still face a fate worse than death.

The  nature  and  impact  of  disasters  are  changing.  They  need  to  be placed in the larger context of present day realities. Most experts refuse to include epidemics in their short list of disasters, costing the world dearly in terms of morbidity, mortality, and hence, the human capital. Today, aid and relief  go  largely  to  non-biological  disasters  while  increasingly  treatment immune  and mutagenic bio-systems wreck havoc in the developing countries. The Surat plague outbreak in 1994 killed 56 people nationwide. This outbreak served as a chilling reminder of how rapid urbanization and deterioration  of  the  urban  environment  can  bring  people  into  contact  with forgotten disease factors. The scientific studies show that an increase in the temperature viz. 1-2 degrees would enable mosquitoes to extent their range to  low  geographical  areas,  leading  to  an  increase  in  cases  of  malaria  and several  other  infectious  diseases  especially  in  populations  living  at  the periphery  of  the  areas  currently  prone  to  these  diseases.  Tuberculosis, Malaria,  Kalajar  Dengue,  plague,  Japanese  encephalitis,  diarrhea  diseases, including  cholera,  poliomyelitis,  HIV/AIDS,  etc.  are  some  of  the  chronic diseases which have caused concern today.

India  has  one  of  the largest populations  of  people  living  with HIV/AIDS,  second only to South Africa. An  estimated 5.1 million individuals currently live with the HIV infection, across all states. The HIV prevalence rate among the adult population is 0.8 per cent, but the absolute

number of people living with HIV/AIDS is very high and growing gradually. The endemic is challenging the development achievements of recent years and  raising  fundamental  issues  of  human  rights.  In  India,  HIV/AIDS epidemic is characterized by heterogeneity; it seems to be following the type 4  pattern,  where  the  epidemic  shifts  from  the  most  vulnerable  populations (including sex workers, injecting drug users, men who have sex with man) to bridge  populations  (client  of  sex  workers,  STD  patients,  partners  of  drug users)  and  then  to  the  general  population.  The  epidemic  continues  to  shift towards woman and young people. Migrates both within and between states is  a  major  source  of  transmission  of  infection.  Srivastava  and  Sasikumar (2003)  estimated  that  migrants  account  for  26.6  per  cent  of  the  country's population. This shows a declining trend, however, the absolute number of migrants grew from 67.7 million in 1971 to 231.9 million in 1991. Migration of  semi  skilled  and  unskilled  labours  to  West  Asia  and  OECD  countries started in mid 1970; the growth in demand for foreign labour was triggered by the oil price boom. South Arabia and UAE were the principal destinations for  Indian  migrants  during  the  past  two  decades  State-wise  distribution  of emigration  clearances  granted  during  the  period  1993-2001  shows  that  16 states contributed to the process of emigration to the OECD countries. Three states - Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh-together accounted for 60 per cent of those who obtained emigration clearance. The returning migrant is often unaware of whichever has been infected with HIV and the potential risk of infection that his spouse and urban children face.

Trans-border  migrants  in  India-  especially  Nepali,  and  Bangladesh migrants also face the high risk of HIV infection.  Nepalese women migrants are highly vulnerable to commercial and sexual exploitation. Those who are

engaged in commercial sex line in unhygienic and inhuman conditions, even those who work as domestic help are at risk of being physically and sexually abused  by  their  employers.  Bangladesh  migrants  are  less  vulnerable  them Nepalese  migrants  however,  their  number  in  India  is  rapidly  increasing which causes severe stress on civic services.

The  illegal  immigration  from  Bangladesh  has  become  a  serious problem;  it  has  changed  the  demographic  landscape  and  affected  Delhi, Rajasthan,  Gujarat,  Maharastra.    In  India,  the  quantum  of  immigration  is small in relation to the total population of the country. There are about 8 to 10  million  Bangladeshis  nationals  in  India  who  are  spread  all  over  north India from  West  Bengal  to  Rajasthan. The  illegal immigration  from Bangladesh  has  caused  concern  in  Mizoram,  Tripura,  Assam,  and  West Bengal.  Even,  it  caused  to  some  extent  the  emergence  of  militancy  and ethnic unrest-ness in North East region of India. The militancy in North East region has caused concuss to the policy makers and development activists.he increasing  trend  of  violence  and  destruction  of  property  in  the  region  has caused setback to development efforts (Table 9 .1).

Though, scheme of rehabilitation of surrendered extremists in North East  has  checked  insurgency,  however,  a  large  number  of  districts  in Tripura, Mizoram, Assam, Manipur and Nagaland are affected with militancy.    Similarly,  the  terrorism  in  Jammu  &amp;  Kashmir  and  Punjab  has derailed  the  development  efforts  for  a  long  time.  However,  terrorism activities  in  Jammu  &amp;  Kashmir,  supported  by  neighbouring  countries  are causing tremendous loss to human lives and public property (Table 9 .2).

The extremism has its root cause in socio-economic backwardness of the region and development deprivation of weaker sections of society. The terrorist activities are being supported by neighbouring countries. These are being  operated  from  Territory  of  Bangladesh,  Pakistan,  Myanmar,  Bhutan and Nepal. There is marked increase in attacks on government and private properties by naxilites displacing a growing penchant for attacking railway property.

## Communal Violence

The  communal  violence  in  India  is  causing  concern.  The  social disharmony, socio cultural factors and political mostilization of communal

groups  may  cause  out  standing  communal  violence.    Some  of  the  major incidents are discussed below:

The following points may be helpful in managing communal riots and terrorism related incidents:

## (i) If Disaster Strikes

-  Remain calm and be patient.
-  Follow the advice of local emergency officials.
-  Listen to your radio or television for news and instructions.
-  If the disaster occurs near you, check for injuries. Give first aid and get help for serious injured people.
-  Shut off any other damaged utilities.
-  Confine or secure your pets.
-  Check  on  your  neighbors,  especially  those  who  are  elderly  or disabled.

## (ii) A Word on What Could Happen

-  There can be significant numbers of causalities and / or damage to buildings  and  the  infrastructure.  So,  employers  need  up-to-date information on how to contact your designated beneficiaries.
-  Heavy law enforcement involvement follows a terrorist attack due to the event's criminal nature.
-  Health  and  mental  health  resources  in  the  affected  communities can be strained to their limits.

-  Extensive  media  coverage,  strong  public  fear  and  international implications and  consequences  can  continue  for  a  prolonged period.
-  Workplaces  and  schools may  be  closed, and there may  be restrictions on domestic and international travel.
-  You and your family or household may have to evacuate an area, avoiding roads blocked for your safety.
-  Clean-up may take many months.

## (iii) Evacuation

If local authorities ask you to leave home, they have a good reason to make this request, and you should need to advice immediately. Keep these simple tips in mind-

-  Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants and sturdy shoes so you can be protected as much as possible.
-  Take your disaster supplies kit.
-  Lock your home.
-  Use travel routes specified by local authorities don't use shortcuts because certain areas may be impassable or dangerous.
-  Shut off water &amp; electricity before leaving.

## (iv) Shelter-in-place

If  you  are  advised  by  local  officials  to  remain  inside  your  home  or office  and  protect  yourself  there,  close  and  lock  all  windows  and  exterior doors. Get your disaster supplies kit, and make sure the radio is working.

## (v) First Aid Primer

If you encounter someone who is injured, apply the emergency action steps.  Check  the  scene  to  make  sure  it  is  safe  for  you  to  approach.  Then check the victim for unconsciousness and life-threatening condition, such as not breathing  or  severe bleeding, requires immediate  care  by  trained responders and may require treatment by medical professionals. Call out for help. There are some steps that you can take, however, to care for someone who is hurt, but whose injuries are not life threatening.

## (a) Control Bleeding

Cover the wound with a dressing, and press firmly against the wound (direct pressure). Elevate the injured area above the level of the heart if you do not suspect that the victim has a broken bone. Cover the dressing with a roller bandage. If the bleeding does not stop,

- (i) Apply additional dressing and bandage.
- (ii) Use a pressure point to squeeze the artery against the bone.

Provide care for shock.

## (b) Care for Shock

Keep the victim from getting chilled or overheated. Elevate the legs about 12 inches (if broken bones are not suspected). Do not give food to the victim.

## (c) Tend Burns

Stop  the  burning  by  cooling  the  burn  with  large  amounts  of  water. Cover the burn with dry, clean dressings or cloth.

## (d) Care for Injuries to Muscles, Bones

Rest the injured part. Apply ice or a cold pack to control swelling and reduce pain. Avoid any movement or activity that causes pain. If you must move the victim because the scene is becoming unsafe, try to immobilize the injured part to keep it from moving.

## (e) Reduce Any Care Risk

The risk of getting a disease while giving first aid is extremely rare. However, to reduce the risk even further;

- (i) Avoid direct contact with blood and other body fluids.
- (ii) Use  protective equipment,  such as disposable gloves and breathing barriers.
- (iii) Wash your hands with soap and water immediately giving care.

## Road Accidents

India like many other developing countries, is witnessing a spiraling increase  in  the  number  of  vehicles  clogging  its  roads.  Between  1970  and 2003, number of registered vehicles increased by about 48 times.  During 2003, registered vehicles were reported to be 67.03 million.  By 2050, there will be over 267 million vehicles on Indian roads. Of the world wide annual average of 0.7 million road accidents, 10 per cent occur in India.  In 2003, number of road accidents was reported to be 406.73 million in which 85.99 million persons were killed.  Number of accidents per ten thousand vehicles was reported to be 60.68 while number of persons killed per ten thousand vehicles  was  12.88.  Most  of  the  road  fatalities  were  reported  in  Andhra Pradesh, Mahrashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka.

The economic cost of road accidents is equivalent to about one per cent of Gross National Product.

A  large  number  of  deaths  in  developing  world  are  due  to  road accidents.  Apart  from  humanitarian  aspect  of  the  problem,  road  accidents cost countries of developing world at least one percentage of their GNP each year. The proportion of commercial and public service vehicles involved in road accidents are often much greater. Pedestrians and cyclist are often the most  vulnerable.  During  the  year  2002,  nearly  85,000  people  died  due  to road accidents in India. Fatality risk (defined as, road accidental deaths per million population) in India is increasing over the years, from 64 in 1990 to 80 in 2002. During the same period, road accidental deaths have increased at a  rate  of  3.8  percent  per  annum  while  the  population  of  the  country  has increased by only 1.8 percent per annum. Although fatality rate (defined as, number of fatalities per 10,000 vehicles) in India is declining over the years, it is still quite high in comparison to developed world.

It  is  alarming  to  note  that  more  than 38 people die per week due to road accidents in Delhi alone. Between the year 1990 and 2000, number of road accidental casualties has increased in almost all the metropolitan cities in India. Analysis shows that except Kolkata, Mumbai, and Nagpur all cities are  showing  very  high  growth  rate  in  fatalities  over  the  period.  Accident severity  index  (defined  as,  number  of  fatalities  per  100  accidents)  is  also very high for all the cities other than Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Mumbai.

Road  traffic  clashes  and  injuries  are  increasing  in  India  due  to increase  in  vehicle  population  and  traffic  density.  Road  accidents  in  India are shown in Table 9.4. There has been phenomena increase in the number of  road  accidents  during  1997-2007.  Similarly,  there  has  been  significant

increase in the road accident injuries increased over the period. The burden of road traffic injuries in India is relatively high in its metropolitan cities. In 2007, fatality risk in 21 out of 35 metropolitan cities was higher than the all India average. On an average, the fatality risk in metropolitan cities is 11.7 fatalities per 1 lakh population, which is higher than the national average of 10.1 per 1 lakh population.

Traffic  crashes  in  Indian  cities  pose  a  severe  public  health  problem resulting each year in about 20000 deaths, 1.2 million serious injuries and 5.6  million  minor  injuries.  The  number  of  traffic  fatalities  has  increased more  than  5  times  since  1971.  Even  the  population  growth  in  India  is reported  to  be  low  than  the  road  accident  rate.  Fatalities  per  million populations were reported to be 77.89 during 2001 while it was only 27.36 during 1971. However, fatalities per 1000 vehicles have come down from 8.04 in 1971 to 1.45 in 2001 (Table 9.6).

Road accidents are caused by several factors, viz., human, automobile, geographical, Infrastructure, information and legal. It is generally acknowledged  that  human  error  is  an  underlined  cause  of  almost  all accidents.  It  is  involved  over  90  per  cent  of  road  accidents  while  a  small proportion of accidents may be directly attributed vehicle defects or faults in road design or maintenance.

The vehicle factors responsible for road accidents include worn tyres, poor breaks and non-functional light, overloading of public service vehicles and tracks, use of unsuitable vehicles like picups for transport of passengers and poor praiseworthiness design.

Road factors responsible for road accidents are related with high or no speed  limits  and  poor  visual  guidance,  poorly  controlled  intersections  and uncontrolled  access,  narrow  roads,  poor  alignment  standards  and  poor maintenance of pavements and shoulders and steep ditches and hard objects near the road.

Traffic and environmental factors include mix of motorized and nonmotorized vehicles, pedestrians, poor traffic  management and enforcement of traffic codes, darkness and inclement weather conditions and inadequate emergency medical services.

Economic pressure factors have also become more important following the liberalization of road transport services, as intense competition for  passengers  have  resulted  more  speeding  and  reckless  driving  of  the public  service  vehicles.  Moreover,  with  the  globalization  and  economic liberalization, there is increasing trend of automobiles  having  speedy pickups with high speed suitability of vehicles, though conditions of roads do  not  support  it.  Thus,  there  will  be  increasing  demand  for  financial resources for catering to the imperatives of road safety measures.

Road safety measures in India vary from state to state and within the state  from  district  to  district  and  within  a  district  from  one  department  to another  department.  The  states  like  Karnataka,  Kerala,  Tamil  Nadu  have performed well in road safety measures while states like Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Haryana mobilized substantial amount of resources for road safety measures.

Road safety being a multi-sectoral activity, its functional responsibility  lies  with  many  key  sectors  associated  with  the  road  safety, structural  conditions  of  roads  and  their  maintenance,  emergency  medical care and rehabilitation, justice, finance, information, education and training,

law enforcement and traffic regulations. In the State of Uttar Pradesh, there are six departments/agencies which have identified as the agencies delivering  road  safety  related  sub  tasks.  These  are  PWD,  Home  (Traffic), Transport, Urban Development, Medical and Public Health &amp; Education.

PWD  is  responsible for formulation of road network projects, construction,  maintenance,  physical  marking  of  extent  of  encroachment  of road  space,  etc.  Home  (Traffic)  Department  is  entrusted  with  the  task  of enforcement of intra city, intercity, inter-district, inter-state traffic on roads and  highways;  checking  of  vehicles  and  drivers  for  compliance  of  Motor Vehicle Acts, &amp; Rules; road safety regulations; rescue, first aid and transport of  accident  victims  to  emergency  and  trauma  care  facility;  filing  of  FIR, accident investigation and pursuing prostitution in road accident cases.

Transport Department is responsible for registration of different types of vehicles, licensing of different categories of drivers, collection of road tax and fee, passengers of goods transport, issuing of permits for special purpose and  specific  destinations  commercial  vehicles;  checking  of  compliance  of rules and regulations on Motor Vehicle Act and road worthiness of vehicles; planning and operation of road transport system; road safety education.

Urban Development is supposed to prevent and remove encroachment;  planning  of  construction  of  new  roads  and  maintenance  of roads within their respective areas of jurisdictions; provisions and maintenance of parking, pavement and pedestrians space; planning, installation  and  maintenance  of  traffic  signaling,  infrastructure  and  traffic regulation, etc. Medical &amp; Health Department is entrusted with post-accident emergency and trauma care of the accident victims. Education Department is supposed  to  provide  road  safety  education  to  school  and  college  going students.

Measures related to road safety in the state are mainly concern with education, awareness creation of road users and installing road safety signs on  sensitive  places.  There  is  lack  of  coordination  among  the  different organizations, departments and officials. There is also lack of mechanism for creating data base related to road accidents, deaths and persons injured. The task  of  road  safety  measures  among  the  different  stakeholders  is  highly fragmented  with  responsibilities  defused  amongst  constituting  sub-sectors viz.,  ambulances,  pre-hospital  care,  transport  authority,  driver  and  vehicle licensing, enforcement of traffic laws and regulations, compliance of Motor Vehicle Acts, etc. Post-accident critical cares of accident victims are highly inadequate in the state. The budgetary provision for road safety financing is grossly inadequate and therefore, resource mobilization for financing of road safety measures is imperative.

India's  Ariel  skies  and  airports  seem  relatively  safe  an  average  of  two accidents and 10 deaths a year, however, India's skies are a battleground of bad policies, civil  military  and  technological  obsolescence.    The  increased aircraft  movement  and  number  of  private  air  lines  have  increased  density with more vulnerability of air accidents.

## Rail Accidents

India has the largest rail system which played by ad-hoc modernization, a bureaucratic outlook on some of the worst global accidents and an inadequately trained work force.  The increasing incidence of bomb blasts and  explosions  in  trains  has  caused  concern.    There  has  been fluctuating  trend  in  rail  accidents  and  fatalities.    During  1997-98,  420  rail accidents  caused  316  fatalities  (Table  IX .5).    During  2001-02,  413  rail accidents occurred in India.  Number of train accidents per million km. has

been reported to be 0.55 while number of casualties per million passengers carried was reported just 0.02 (Table 9 .7).

Thus  it  is  clear  that  a  number  of  human  induced  disasters  cause concern  and  call  for  strategic  planning  to  mitigate  and  manage  them. Moreover, manmade disasters may be checked and the adverse effects may be drastically reduced through proper planning and management.

## Chapter-10

## DISASTER MITIGATION

## Disaster Preparedness Measures

It is a broad concept that describes a set of measures that minimizes the  adverse  effects  of  a  hazard  including  loss  of  life  and  poverty  and disruption of livelihoods. Disaster preparedness is achieved through readiness  measures  that  expedite  emergency  response,  rehabilitation  and recovery and result in rapid, timely and targeted assistance. Most important factor is to increase capacities of people and communities to cope with and minimize the effects of a disaster on their lives. It must be done with their active participation.

Risk Assessment: All planning and implementation of disaster preparedness measures is passed on an assessment of the hazards and risks, as well as the ability or inability of the people to withstand the effects of those hazards. It is based on identification of-

- (a) Characteristics,  frequency  and  potential  severity  of  the  hazards  a community faces.
- (b) Geographical  areas  and  communities  that  is  most  susceptible  and vulnerable to those hazards.
- (c) Main  sectors  of  a  community  (population  infrastructure,  housing, services, etc.) that would be affected by a specific type of hazard and anticipate how they might be affected.

- (d) The  ability  of  those  sectors  to  withstand  and  cope  with  effects  of hazardous phenomena.

Response  Strategies: To  increase  the  effectiveness  of  the  emergency response, strategies and mechanisms are to be strengthened. They include,

-  Evacuation procedure,
-  Search and rescue teams,
-  Assessment teams,
-  An  assessment  process  and  information  priorities  for  an  emergency response.
-  Procedures for activating distribution systems,
-  Preparations for emergency reception centers and shelters,
-  Procedures  for  activating  emergency  programs  for  airports,  harbors and land transport,
-  Preparations for storing or making arrangements for rapid acquisition of emergency  relief supplies and equipment,
-  Measures  to  activate  special  installations,  such  as  emergency  or mobile hospital facilities.

Preparedness Plan: Emergency requires an immediate response. It depends upon  the  existence  and  implementation  of  the  plan.  The  plan  is  not  site specific, nor does it contain the details of the disaster. However it contains the  methodology  of  emergency  response.  The  response  team  is  trained  on the  basis  of  this  plan.  It  involves  identification  of  resources,  roles  and responsibilities of the team, policy development, procedures and whatever is required  for  the  effective  and  timely  emergency  response.  All  of  these measures  will go a long way  to improving  the  quality, timing and

effectiveness  of  the  response  to  a  disaster.  The  aim  of  the  preparedness planning  is  to  build,  equip,  train  and  organize  disaster  response  team  that will function effectively in the emergency.

Coordination: The emergency response demands a variety of skills, which are  provided  by  different  specialist  teams  and  agencies.  Coordination  of these various teams and the agencies, to prevent duplication of work is the single  most  critical  task  of  the  project  director.  It  is  very  common  in  our country  to see the Service Organizations  and  Government  machinery replicating  the  food  distribution  to  the  disaster  affected  people.  The  most important  issue  involved  in  the  coordination  is  the  mutual  trust  and  the confidence amongst the various components of the disaster response teams.

Information Management: Disaster preparedness and response depend on gathering, analyzing and acting on timely and accurate information before (hazard and early warning information), during (disaster needs assessment) and after disasters (process of post-disaster recovery). Once a disaster strike, relief  agency  must  conduct  initial  assessments  that  are  timely  and  that inform  emergency  responders  about  critical  and  immediate  life-saving needs.  Disaster  needs  assessments  should  develop  a  picture  of  location, condition, activity, needs and the resources of the affected people.

Early Warning Systems: The purpose of early warning system is to detect, forecast,  and  when  necessary,  issue  alerts  related  to  impending  hazard events.  Early  warning  systems  have  to  be  supported  by  information  about the  actual  and  potential  risks  that  a  hazard  poses,  as  well  as  the  safety measures  people  can  take.  To  achieve  the  best  results  early  warning information has to be communicated to the potential victims of the disaster.

The people too often ignore early warnings. Credibility of the source is one of the main reasons.

Resource Mobilization: A preparedness plan should spell out the policies for  acquisition  and  disbursement  of  funds  use  of  outside  equipment  and services,  and  emergency  funding  strategies  well  before  a  disaster  occurs. The disaster management agency must have certain emergency funds at their disposal.  If  procedural  sanctions  and  clearances  are  required  before  their availability,  the  response  will  be  delayed.  Large  numbers  of  organizations are  giving  funds  for  specific  functions  in  disaster-affected  region.  Some agencies  are  providing  funds  for  reconstruction  only,  while  others  are making the funds available for rescue and relief work only. Some agencies are  funding  through the  government,  or  government agencies while others are funding through the NGOs only. Thus with such a wide spectrum of fund distribution  methods  and  functions,  the  disaster  planners  must  be  fully conversant with the different lending agencies as well as their methodology of funding. The planners must have full list of donors and their conditions. Similarly  a  definite  arrangement  must  be  available  for  the  accessing  the funds from the International Agencies.

Public Awareness, Education and Training: Disaster  preparedness  must have sizable contribution from the affected people. As the major stakeholders they have right to know about the proposed preparedness plan, and the rescue, relief rehabilitation and construction measures. The awareness  measures  will  be  supported  by  public  education  campaigns, training of response teams and rehearsals of emergency response scenarios.

Community  Based  Disaster  Preparedness: Disaster  preparedness  and response are not solely the work of experts and emergency responders from national Societies and government disaster organizations. Local volunteers, citizens, organizations, and businesses have an active and important role to play  before,  during  and  after  major  emergencies  and  disasters.  Local populations  in  disaster-stricken  areas  are  the  first  to  respond  to  a  disaster. They  are  usually  involved  in  search  and  rescue  activities  as  well  as  in providing  emergency  treatment  and  relief  to  their  families,  friends  and neighbor.

State  Level  Plan: In  our  country,  the  actual  execution  of  the  various schemes, relief etc is done by the state machinery. Therefore the organizational  plans  which  cover  the  role  and  responsibilities  of  various authorities and organization required for its execution. State level plans are confirmed mitigation and after disaster recovery. They will provide backing to the local level plans for immediate relief.

Local Bodies: They are the third level of Governance in our country. They are the ones who are in actual contact with the disaster location. Naturally the  planning  at  their  level  will  be  confined  to  the  preparedness,  local operations, and immediate relief, whereas other aspects such as mitigation and recovery measures are normally directed from state level.

Community Based Plan: At the community or village level the capabilities and limitations will obviously vary considerably between different circumstances,  and  this  point  must  be  taken  into  account  in  disaster preparedness measures generally. On first reflection, it may be felt that little disaster  preparedness  capability  exists  at  community  of  village  level;  and

that, when disaster strikes it is largely a question of government sending in assistance mostly in the form  of equipment, supplies, and specialist manpower. This is not necessarily true. All communities and villages have some vitally important assets when it comes to dealing with disaster. These include  local  knowledge  and  experience.  Clearly,  these  assets  need  to  be organized and utilized to optimum effect. This local knowledge contains.

-  Traditional capability for reading disaster-warning signs,
-  Knowledge of local safe and vulnerable areas,
-  Experience and lore concerning disaster impact,
-  Survival experience in face of disaster loss,
-  Understanding of the hierarchical local system which may be essential in disaster circumstances,
-  They have inherent capability to utilize the extended family system, which is often vitally important in withstanding crisis.

## Basic Skills Required

The modern day disaster mitigation and management requires a high level  of  professional  skill,  while  volunteers  will  always  be  important  in disaster response operations, staff involved in planning, situation evaluation, needs assessment or service delivery have to be equipped with the technical and  management  skill  required  to  participate  in  increasingly  complex programs. It is an establishment fact that the disasters of different types will require different types of trained rescue workers, and the equipments. The skills  required  for  rescue  work  cannot  be  dealt  in  isolation.  They  have  to dovetail into the holistic picture of the disaster management plan as stated earlier.  The  post  disaster  management  can  be  divided  into  four  distinct

phases. First phase is the rescue work, which involves saving the victims of the  disaster.  Second  phase  is  the  relief,  which  involves  comforting  the victims and establishment of order at the disaster location. The third is the rehabilitation of the victims. The fourth and the last phase is Reconstruction. It  also  takes  the  longest  time.  The  first  phase  is  the  most  critical  from  the point of view of saving human lives. It also has a very short duration when the victims can be saved. This makes rescue work the most critical so far as the  disaster  management  is  concerned.  Thus  the  rescue  workers  must  be trained and equipped to deal with the ground realities. Then and only then they can be effective in saving the human lives. The skills required in the disaster management include those required for (1) Rescue Work, (2) Relief, (3) Rehabilitation, and (4) Reconstruction. The skills can be disaster specific for Rescue and the relief works. Rehabilitation and Reconstruction are more or less similar in the different types of disasters. The most common natural disasters affecting our country are, (1) Earthquakes, (2) Floods, (3) Landslides,  (4)  Hurricanes,  (5)  Drought  and  Desertification.  The  different types of skills required for the management of these disasters is comprehensive and a can be listed under different categories.

Basic  Search  and  Rescue: Emergency  response  is  one  of  the  most demanding forms of activity worldwide because it operates in conditions of uncertainty, often in remote locations and within severe time constraints. It therefore  tests  the  management  and  logistic  capabilities  of  the  agencies involved to the limit. These teams are the first to reach the disaster locations. Their  basic  function  is  to  provide  First  Aid  to  the  disaster  affected  and organize  Rescue  operation.  These  tasks  require  certain  basic  skills.  These

include-

-  Civil Defense to organize rescue operations,
-  Fire protection in case of fire hazard,
-  Ground and a serial first-aid service,
-  Medical help in disasters,
-  Environmental protection,
-  Emergency supplies and provision of food,
-  Labor safety and occupational hygiene,
-  Water and food protection and treatment,
-  Rescue operations in traffic crashes,
-  Rescue and first-aid service in mining and mountaineering,
-  Protection of material values and property rescue operations in natural disasters.

The disasters victims in these categories are affected more severely than the other victims. They required specialist treatment. The medical team should have  trained  persons  to  deal  with  these  categories  of  patients.  In  case  of severe  disasters  like  Earthquakes  or  Major  floods  the  mass  fatalities  are common phenomena. To deal with the ground situation, it requires skill of the  highest  order.  Disposal  or  cremation  of  the  dead  bodies  becomes  a serious problem  and places a heavy strain on the resources of the organization.  This  situation  is further complicated  by  the  problem  of identification of the dead.

Technical skills are the specialized engineering skills in various fields. The specialists in these fields are professionals and required very little training before inducting them into rescue work.

Communication is one of the most important part of the disaster management work. The biggest problem faced by the planners is the level of dependence  of  the  existing  communication  network,  either  in  the  form  of landlines, or cell phones. Both the forms of communication are susceptible to  damage  in  the  event  of  disaster.  The  only  reliable  link  can  be  wireless network.  Unfortunately  it  requires  specialist  knowledge  for  operation  and maintenance.  Satellite  linked  phones  can  be  a  better  option  but  it  is exorbitantly expensive.

The disaster  affected  areas  might  contain  a  number  of  utility  services  like electricity, water supply, telephones, and gas lines for domestic or industrial supply petrol oil and lubricant storage at the petrol pumps. The live electric lines, gas lines and water lines can pose a serious threat to life. They have to be effectively disabled to prevent accidents. It requires technical as well as the local knowledge.

Like any large scale project the disaster mitigation and management project is a  multidisciplinary  and  multi  specialty  project.  To  conduct  such  an operation  a  variety  of  organizational  skills  and  the  best  of  the  project management skills are required.

Every project throws up a variety of problems during the execution stage. Despite of the care taken at the planning stage to avoid such situation, these emergencies  are  increasing.  The  emergency  planners  are  required  to  take care of this situation and find away to by pass the emergencies and permit the project to run smoothly.

The  manpower  requirement  in  the  disaster  management  is  very  large.  To mobilize and organize such a large force of volunteers is a Herculean task. The volunteers are invariably untrained or at best semi-trained persons. To motivate such a force requires very high level of commitment  and organization  skill.  The  decision-making  capability  is  a  gift  and  very  few people have this capability. It is more so in case of a crisis situation. The decision has to be made at that point of time. Correctness of the decision can only be judged by subsequent results. The project Managers is the specialists who oversee the project execution. Their main functions are to ensure that-

-  Resources are deployed at right time,
-  Adequate resources are available,
-  Coordination between different agencies or Groups,
-  Monitoring the progress of the project.

Finance  or  the  Money  forms  an  important  part  of  resources.  The  main sources of funds are the Government departments, Voluntary Organizations, Public and Private sectors. All of them have their own rules, regulations and other  conditions  for  the  release  of  funds.  These  conditions  have  to  be fulfilled.  The  funds  have  to  be  deployed  for  productive  work.  All  this process requires specialist knowledge and skills.

- (a) Strategic Planning,
- (b) Leadership,
- (c) Decision Making

In any emergency, people will generally suffer from varying degrees of  anxiety.  Any  emotional  support  will  help  to  reduce  excessive  stress reactions. Possible source for emotional support skills may include

following  categories  of  persons  who  have  experience  in  counseling  and providing emotional support.

-  Teachers,
-  Counselors,
-  Nurses,
-  First responder,
-  Social Workers,
-  Religious Workers,
-  Persons with crisis management skills,
-  Volunteers

Integration of the skills in Disaster management plan-All the skills listed above are integral part of disaster management, Most of the skills are part of some Medical, Technical Management sciences. There are qualified specialists working in these fields. To integrate these skills into the disaster management plan will mean bringing in all these specialists into the action plan.  Then  only  these  skills  can  be  utilized  in  the  execution  of  the  action plan. The plan has to be prepared by professional planners.

## Manpower Mobilisation and Training

The requirement of manpower for disaster management is very high. The mobilizing such a huge force is itself is a formidable job. It a common practice all over the world to look for the manpower from various organized and  disciplined  groups  like  armed  forces,  civil  defense  fire  brigade  etc. There is  another  big  source  of  manpower  that  has  not  been  paid  adequate

attention.  These are the local population who are the biggest stakeholders. The various sources of manpower are:

-  Government Departments,
-  Use of Armed Forces,
-  Non-Governmental organizations, (NGOs)
-  Peoples Participation as main Stakeholders,
-  Community Based Volunteer force for Relief and Rescue work.

The basic  requirement  of  the  rescue  volunteers  is  that  they  must  be properly organized, should have discipline, adequate resources to operate on their own if necessary and last but not the least they must have some basic rescue and or disaster management training.

Armed Forces: Referring  to  the  above  list,  we  find  armed  forces  are  the only  group  coming  closet  to  the  requirements.  Unfortunately  their  main training  and  responsibility  is  National  defense.  The  deployment  of  armed forces for disaster management or counter insurgency is not a good practice. It affects their training as well as their moral. This point has been stressed by the Armed forces high command  as well as various high-powered committees.  Unfortunately  we  lack  an  organized,  disciplined  and  trained force to counter the disasters as well as the insurgency.

Government Departments: The  Government departments have very little training and organization to combat any disaster. Their best use will be for organizing the back end of the project execution like inventory management, supply and logistics, emergency centers management.

Non-Government Organizations (NGOs): Some of the organizations like Red  Cross,  St.  John  Ambulance  Brigade  are  reasonably  organized  and adequately  trained  for  disaster  management.  Their  limitations  are  their limited authority to undertake the disaster management on their own. They have to tie up with government officials.

Community based Volunteer Force: This  is  one  area  where  India  as  a nation has not done any effort to form such a force. Our thrust has always been  on  Government  doing  everything  themselves.  It  resulted  in  chaos. Number of Government appointed committees have recommended formation  of  a  disaster  management  agency  on  the  lines  on  the  lines  of FEMA  of  USA.  They  have  recommended  formation  of  an  independent ministry  for  this  work.  Formation  of  community  based  response  teams (CRT) in disaster prone area is a necessity. These teams can then become the first  respondents  in  case  of  emergency.  At  the  moment  no  such  facility  is available anywhere  in  the  country. We  are  totally dependant  on  the Government machinery. The volunteer force can be raised on the lines  of Territorial Army where the participants are part time service personnel. They are  paid  partial  wages  during  peace  postings  and  full  pay  when  on  active duty.  The  deployment  of  ex-servicemen  in  this  force  would  be  a  good option.  The  National  Social  service  group,  which  forms  the  chunk  of university  students,  would  be  another  source  of  volunteers.  They  can  be easily trained in disaster management. As it is they are in contact with the local population an account of their social work, their contact can be further utilized for disaster management through public awareness programmes.

People's Participation: It is extremely important that the main stakeholders be involved in this process of disaster management. The biggest stumbling block in this process is the mistrust the people have against the officialdom. An  average  person  does  not  want  to  have  anything  to  do  with  the departments  like  Police,  Revenue,  RTO  or  the  Health  departments.  Under the give situation Government  machinery  must  win  the  trust  of the stakeholder  population  and  bring  about  the  disaster  awareness  and  the participation.

The  second  problem  in  dealing  with  the  Government  machinery  is their obsession  with  secrecy  and  the  lack  of  transparency.  All  plans, programmes,  schemes  are  kept  within  the  four  walls  of  the  offices.  Even with the right to information bill, having passed, the information is not easily available.  One  of  the  best  examples  is  the  disaster  map  of  India.  This document is available on CD costing Rs. 3000. In fact it should be freely available on line. Unless this system is drastically altered, peoples' participation will remain only on paper like so many other things.

Different  Levels  of  Responsibility: The  manpower  mobilized  for  the disaster  management  has  to  clearly  deployed,  depending  on  their  training, skill  levels,  and  equipment  available  with  them.  FEMA  has  classified  the levels depending on the above factors. In an earthquake the classification is a follows.

-  The most skilled and trained teams are the Urban Search and Rescue. It is their responsibility to look for the victims who are entombed and whose rescue requires specialized equipment and trained rescue teams to rescue them.

-  Second  level  of  rescue  is  for  the  victims  trapped  under  collapsed structures but is visible and accessible to the rescue teams they are to be attended by the emergency service providers.
-  Third level of rescue work is by the community response teams who will  attend  to  the  victims  entrapped  under  minor obstruction  that do not need specialists equipment and expertise as in the first two cases.
-  Fourth level of rescue is by the rescuers from the disaster location and has  preliminary  knowledge  of  first  aid  and  can  attend  the  injured victims.

## Chapter-11

## DISASTER MANAGEMENT

India has been traditionally vulnerable to natural disasters on account of its unique geo-climate conditions. Floods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes  and  landslides  are  regular  phenomena  in  India.  The  multihazard  scenario  depicted  in  the  Vulnerability  Atlas  of  India  (produced  by Building  Materials  and  Technology  Promotion  Council  (BMTPC),  New Delhi, India), shows that out of the total geographical area of 32, 87, 263 sq. km,  about  60%  of  the  landmass  is  prone  to  earthquakes  of  various intensities; over 40 million hectares is prone to floods; about 8% of the total area  is  prone  to  cyclone  and  68%  of  the  area  is  susceptible  to  drought. During 1990-2000, on an average of about 4344 people lost their lives, about 30 million people were affected by various disasters every year and average annual damage has been estimated to be approximately 2700 million rupees. As per the World Bank estimates, during 1996-2001 the total losses due to disasters,  including  the  super  cyclone  of  Orissa  in  October  1999  and  the Bhuj earthquake in Gujarat in January, 2001, amounts to US$ 13.8 billion.

Over  the  past  two  decades,  there  has  been  an  increase  in  disaster occurrences  costing  human  and  economic  losses.  This  is  due  to  the  ever increasing vulnerabilities of people to natural disasters. The need is felt to reduce  disaster  risks  by  improving  capabilities  of  people  and  ensuring preparedness, mitigation and response planning processes at various levels. The  objective  is  to  look  at  the  entire  cycle  of  disaster  management  in reducing risk and linking it to developmental planning process. In the past, disasters were viewed as isolated events, responded to by the Governments

and  various  agencies  without  taking  into  account  the  social  and  economic causes  and  long  term  implication  of  these  events.  In  short,  disasters  were considered as emergencies.

The recent disasters and its socio-economic impact on the country at large, and in particular the communities has underscored the need to adopt a multi dimensional approach involving diverse scientific, engineering, financial and social processes to reduce vulnerability in multi-hazard prone areas. in view of this, the Government of India has brought about a paradigm shift in its approach to disaster management. The change is from "relief and emergency  response"  to  a  balanced  approach  covering  all  phases  of  the Disaster Management Cycle. The approach acknowledges disaster management  as  a  part  of  the  development  process,  and  investments  in mitigation  are  perceived  to  be  much  more  cost  effective  than  relief  and rehabilitation  expenditure.  In  this  regard,  Government  of  India  has  taken various initiatives in area of disaster preparedness, mitigation and response through  networking  of  various  institutions,  institutional  capacity  building, and policy interventions at all levels.

Community participation and community ownership risk reduction is one of the key factors in reducing vulnerabilities of people and minimizing the  loss.  The  Government  of  India's  focus  Community  Based  Disaster Preparedness  (CBDP)  approach  promotes  community  involvement  and strengthening of their capacities for vulnerability reduction through decentralized  planning  process.  This  document  deals  with  the  concept, component and some of the best practices in India.

## Institutional Arrangements

India  has  integrated  administrative  machinery  for  management  of disasters  at  national,  state,  district  and  sub-district  levels.    However,  the basic responsibility of undertaking rescue, relief and rehabilitation measures is that of state government concerned. The Central Government supplements  the  efforts  of  the  states  by  providing  financial  and  logistic support.

The  Contingency  Action  Plan  identifies  initiatives  required  to  be taken by various Central Ministries and Public Departments in the wake of natural  disasters.    Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  is  the  nodal  Ministry  for coordination of relief and response and overall natural disaster management, and the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation is the nodal Ministry for drought  management.    Other  Ministries  are  assigned  the  responsibility  of providing emergency support in case of disasters that fall in their purview as indicated in the Table 11.1

## Ministries Responsive For Various Categories of Disasters

Table - 11.1

| Disaster Type                                      | Nodal Ministry                    |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Natural Disaster &amp; Management (Other than Drought) | Ministry of Home Affairs          |
| Drought Relief                                     | Ministry of Agriculture           |
| Air Accidents                                      | Ministry of Civil Aviation        |
| Railway Accidents                                  | Ministry of Railways              |
| Chemical Disasters                                 | Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests |
| Biological Disasters                               | Ministry of Health                |
| Nuclear Disasters                                  | Department of Atomic Energy       |

The responsibility to cope with natural disasters is essentially that of the state Government.  The Chief Secretary of the state heads a state level Committee which is in overall charge of the relief operations in the state and the Relief Commissioners who are in charge of the relief and rehabilitation measures in the wake of natural disasters in their states function under the overall direction and control of the state level Committee.  In many states, Secretary, Department of Revenue is also in charge of relief.

The district administration is the focal point for implementation of all governmental  plans  and  activities.    The  administration  of  relief  is  the responsibility of the Collector/District Magistrate who exercises coordinating  and  supervising  powers  over  all  departments  at  the  district level.

The  73 rd and  74 th constitutional  amendments  gave  the  status  of 'Institutions of self government'  to Panchayati Raj Institutions. The constitutional  amendments  also  laid  down  necessary  guidelines  for  the structure  of  their  composition,  powers,  functions,  devolution  of  finances, regular holding of elections and reservation of seats for weaker sections and women.    These  local  bodies  may  be  effective  instruments  in  tackling disasters through early warming system, relief distribution, providing shelter to the victims, medical assistant etc.  The Eleventh Finance Commission too paid  detailed  attention  to  the  issue  of  disaster  management  and  came  out with a number of recommendations, including expenditure on restoration of infrastructure and other capital assets as well as capacity building.  Training and  education  are  crucial  for  mitigating  disasters  and  also  for  disaster response.    Training  is  an  integral  part  of  the  capacity  building  as  trained

personnel respond much better to different disasters.  The multi sectoral and multi  hazard  prevention  based  approach  to  disaster  management  requires specific professional inputs.  Similarly, preventive disaster management and development of a national ethos of prevention calls for awareness generation at all levels.  Again, capacity building should not be limited to professionals and  personnel  involved  in  disaster  management  but  should  also  focus  on building the knowledge, attitude and skills of a community to cope with the effects of disasters.

The Yokohama Convention in May 1994 underlined the need for an emphatic  shift  in  the  strategy  for  disaster  management.    It  was  inter  alia stressed that disaster prevention mitigation, preparedness and relief are four elements which contribute to and gain from the implementation of sustainable  development  policies.    The  Government  of  India  has  adopted mitigation and prevention as essential components of development strategy. In  order  to  respond  affectively  to  flood,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  has initiated  National  Disaster  Risk  Management  Programme  in  all  the  flood prone states.  Elected representatives and officials of local bodies are being trained in flood disaster management under the programme.  Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal, Assam and Uttar Pradesh are among 17 multi hazards prone states  where  this  programme  is  being  implemented  with  assistance  from UNDP, USAID and European Commission.

A comprehensive programme has been taken up for earth quake risk mitigation.    The  building  construction  in  urban  and  sub-urban  areas  is regulated  by  Town  Country  Planning  Acts  and  Building  Regulations.    A National  Core  Group  for  Earthquake  Risk  Mitigation  has  been  constituted

consisting of experts in earthquake engineering and administration.  Review of  Building  Bye-Laws  and  Adoption  is  being  insured  by  the  various  state Governments.  A National Programme for Capacity Building of Engineers and Architects in Earthquake Risk Mitigation has been implemented by the Central Government. Training for rural masons  for construction of earthquake resistance buildings and houses is being provided under UNDP Government of India,  Disaster  Management  Programme  in  various  States. Retrofitting of lifeline buildings is also been insured by the State Governments.  An Earthquake Mitigation Project has been drawn with an estimated  cost  of  Rs.  1132  crores.    The  programme  includes  training  of masons  in  earthquake  resistance  constructions  and  adopting  techno-legal regimes by state governments.  Accelerated Urban Earthquake Vulnerability Reduction Programme has been taken in 38 cities in Seismic Zone III, IV and V in a population of half a million and above.  Training Programmes have been organized for engineers and architects to impart knowledge about seismically  safe  construction  and  implementation  of  Bureau  of  Indian Standards Norms.  A National Cyclone Mitigation Project with cost of Rs. 1050  crores  has  been  drawn  up  in  cyclone  prone  states.    The  project envisages  construction  of  cyclone  shelters,  coastal  shelter  belt  plantation, strengthening  of  warning  systems,  training  and  education  etc.    A  Disaster Risk  Management  Programme  has been taken  in  169  districts  in  17  multi hazards  state  prone  with  assistance  from  UNDP,  USAID  and  European Union.    Importantly,  Disaster  Management  Faculties  have  already  been created in Administrative Training Institutes located in 28 districts.  Disaster Management as a subject in social sciences has been introduced in school curriculum for classes VIII and IX.  Besides, 8 battalions of Disaster Risk Response have been created for providing prompt response during disasters.

In  order  to  provide  training  and  knowledge  for  prevention,  mitigation, response of disaster as well as rehabilitation and reconstruction of affected persons and areas, academic institutions have been established with financial assistance from government.  However, disaster management required multi disciplinary and pro active approach.

## Disaster Management

## 1. Preparedness

This protective process embraces measures which enable governments,  communities  and  individuals  to  respond  rapidly  to  disaster situations to cope with them effectively. Preparedness includes the formulation of viable emergency  plans, the development  of warning systems, the maintenance of inventories and the training of personnel. It may also  embrace  search  and  rescue  measures  as  well  as  evacuation  plans  for areas that may be at risk from a recurring disaster.

Preparedness  therefore  encompasses  those  measures  taken  before  a disaster  event  which  are  aimed  at  minimizing  loss  of  life,  disruption  of critical  services,  and  damage  when  the  disaster  occurs.  All  preparedness planning need to be supported by appropriate legislation with clear allocation of responsibilities and budgetary provisions.

## 2. Mitigation

Mitigation embraces all measures taken to reduce both the effect of the  hazard  itself  and  the  vulnerable  conditions  to  it  in  order  to  reduce  the scale of a future disaster. Therefore mitigation activities can be focused on the  hazard  itself  or  the  elements  exposed  to  the  threat.  Examples  of

mitigation measures  which  are  hazard  specific  include  modifying  the occurrence  of  the  hazard,  e.g.  water  management  in  drought  prone  areas, avoiding  the  hazard  by  sitting  people  away  from  the  hazard  and  by strengthening structures to reduce damage when a hazard occurs.

In  addition  to  these  physical  measures,  mitigation  should  also  be aimed at reducing the physical, economic and social vulnerability to threats and the underlying causes for this vulnerability.

Human Capacity: Human capacities  are  the  qualities  are  resources  of  an individual or community to anticipate, cope with, resist and recover from the impact of a hazard. Human  Capacities  and  Human  vulnerability  are inversely related. Higher the Human capacity lower will be the vulnerability and vice versa.

## Approaches of Disaster Management

Disaster risk management can be addressed in three ways: structural measures, non-structural measures and establishing communication networks.    Structural  measures  would  reduce  the  impact  of  disasters  and non-structural measures would enhance the management skills and improve capacities of the community, local self governments, urban local bodies and the state authorities to prepare, prevent and respond effectively to disasters. Non-structural measures  are  more  important  and  include  vulnerability mapping, risk assessment analysis, hazard zoning, inventory of resources to meet the emergency etc. The approaches of disaster management are shown in chart 11.1

- 5. Disaster medicine and epidemiology approach

Focus  is  on  mass  casualty  management, trauma treatment and epidemiological surveillance of communicable diseases.

- 6. Technical approach

Focus is on scientific and technical aspects of disasters. Major areas of interest are seismology, volcano logy, geomorphology and geophysical approaches to disasters.

- 7. Human ecology approach

Meleti (1980)

Focus is on determinants of human behaviour  and  the  process  that  facilitates human  adjustments  to  disasters  through social organizations.

The  dynamics  and  machinery  of  urban  development  is  complex. Therefore,  careful  attention  is  needed  to  find  the  best  opportunities  and effective  routes  to  introduce  safety  measures.    Many  authorities  fail  to recognize the rich range of measures that need to be adopted and integrated into  a  viable  and  affordable  programme.    The  expanding  scale  of  urban pressures,  problems,  and risks in  India  is a  daunting  challenge.    However, India has certain assets that many countries envy when it comes to reducing urban  risks.    There  is  strong  and  increasing  government  commitment  to disaster protection, a vibrant civil society's network which provides base of community participation and high share of private sector in humanitarian aid to disaster's victims and reconstructions of disaster affected areas.  However, there is lack of coordination and integrated approach for disaster response.

Chart  -  11.2  denotes  elements  of  disaster  management.    There  are mainly three elements of disaster mitigation viz. risk management,

prevention  and  preparedness.    Chart  -  11.2  shows  functional  structure  of natural  disaster  mitigation.    The  main  three  elements  are  rehabilitation, prevention  and  response.    In  responsive  measures,  relief,  medical  aid, shelter,  food  rescue,  warning,  evacuation,  assessment  of  vulnerability  and risks, public awareness, capacity building for livelihoods restoration etc. are included.

Disasters are the ultimate test of emergency response capability.  The ability to effectively deal with disasters is becoming relevant because of the increasing risk factors.  Increase in population density population shifts and increasing technology are some of the important factors for increasing risks, leading  to  disasters.    As  areas  become  more  densely  populated,  there  are more potential victims when a disaster strikes.    National  disasters such  as earthquakes,  hurricanes,  cyclones,  Tsunami,  and  floods  tend  to  result  in greater losses due to densely populated areas in India.  Another reason for increasing disaster losses are that population density in disaster prone areas is increasing.  The increasing settlements development in high risk areas is the cause of concern.  The pattern of settlement in high risk areas is reflected in the increasing mortality ratio in India.  In the process of setting high risk areas, natural protection against environmental threats is removed.  In India, the  vegetative  coverage  and  forests  were  destroyed  in  coastal  areas  for promoting  shrimp  farming,  business,  and  tourism  and  housing  colonies. This lead to damage of natural protection against hurricanes, and Tsunami and ultimately Tsunami affected to the large population in coastal areas in southern states recently.  The vulnerability of people living in high risk areas is increasing because the habitations are often unaware of potential risks and how to deal with them.  Even, the prices of land for house construction in high risk areas are lower which attract people for housing construction, even without  proper  approval  of  housing  structures. People  are  living in structures that are not designed to resist the forces of local hazards.  In India, earthquakes have affected severely due to lack of good design technology and inadequate earthquake resistance housing and building structures.  The new  technology  is  also  adding  to  the  list  of  disaster  agents  at  an  ever increasing  rate.    A  large  quantity  of  hazardous  chemicals,  wastes,  bio-

medical wastes, and dumping adds proliferation of high risk office buildings and  hotels  that  subject  their  inhabitants  to  fire  threats  not  experienced before.    The  society  is  also  becoming  more  dependent  on  technology  and specialization,  making  more  vulnerable  to  disaster.    Our  dependence  on computers is introducing a new form of disaster vulnerability.

In the context  of  ever  increasing  risks  of  disaster losses, it is imperative  to  deal  with  these  catastrophes  with  full  preparedness  and planning.    In  disasters  there  are  often  conditions  that  may  make  the traditional division of labour and  resources, characteristics of routine emergency  management,  unsuitable  for  disaster  response.    These  are  as follows:

-  Disaster  may  put  demands  on  organizations,  requiring  them  to make internal changes in structure and delegation of responsibilities;
-  Disasters may create demands that exceed the capacities of single organizations,  requiring  them  to  share  tasks  and  resources  with other organizations that use unfamiliar procedures;
-  Disaster may attract the participation of organization and individual volunteers who usually do not respond to emergencies;
-  Disasters may cross jurisdictional boundaries, resulting in multiple organizations being faced with overlapping responsibilities;
-  Disasters  may  create  new  tasks  for  which  no  organization  has traditional responsibility;
-  Disasters may render unusable the normal tools and facilities used in emergency response;

-  Disasters may result in the spontaneous formation of new organizations that did not exist before.

The  typical  response  to  a  disaster  includes  multiple  independent organizations  from  the  private  sector  as  well  as  from  agencies  of  city, country,  state,  region  and  district  governments.  Disasters  do  not  need  to cover large geographical areas in order to cross multiple levels of government  responsibility.    However,  disaster  management  is  the  only responsibility  of  government.    Community  based  organizations  and  NGOs have to play a critical role in disaster management.    Disasters are characterized by great uncertainty.  Often the character and extent of damage and  the  secondary  threats  are  not  immediately  apparent  and  therefore  the necessary counter measures not undertaken.  Disasters often create the need for  different  organizations  to  share  resources.    Therefore,  coordination  of multi  organizational  task  accomplishment  is  required.    The  needs  such  as fuel and maintenance for vehicles, sanitary facilities, food, shelter and rest facilities, relief and replacement, personnel and emergency message, contact arrangement also are to be included in the logistic support of an organization responding  to  a  disaster.    In  contrast  to  daily  emergencies,  disasters  often call for large scale search and rescue operations.  An important security task in disasters is keeping unauthorized persons out of the disaster area in order to prevent looting and decrease congestion hampering rescue efforts, and to prevent  persons  from  being  injured  in  the  wreckage.    Moreover,  mass handling  of  the  dead  creates  problems  that  may  not  have  been  faced  in routine emergencies.    Handling  the  dead  poses  different  problems  in disasters.  The other tasks that are important in disaster response are:

-  Warning and communicating with the public
-  Shelter and feeding of displaced persons
-  Evacuating neighborhoods
-  Evacuating hospitals, prisons, nursing homes and psychiatric facilities
-  Coordinating volunteers
-  Acquiring and allocating unusual resources
-  Dealing with mass arrival carcasses
-  Dealing  with  livestock  or  family  pets  that  had  to  be  left  behind  or sheltered
-  Procedures for condemning damaged buildings
-  Disposing of unclaimed valuable and merchandise found in the rubble at the scene
-  Control of air traffic
-  Disposing of large amounts of donations
-  Controlling  emergency  vehicle  traffic  in  order  to  avoid  blockage  of routes by emergency vehicles
-  Checking the hospitals, nursing homes and day care centers that may need assistance
-  Prioritizing of utility sources delivery

Adequate  communication  is  a  recurring  challenge  in  disaster  response. The  importance  of  communication  is  its  ability  to  get  people  to  work together on a common task or toward a common goal to coordinate.  It is the process  by  which  each  person  understands  that  how  his  individual  efforts intermesh  with  those  of  others.  The  information  is  required  for  need assessment and rescue operations. The most crucial types of information that need to be shared are related to:

-  An  ongoing  assessment  of  what  the  disaster  situation  is  and  what disaster counter measures need to be undertaken;
-  An ongoing determination of what resources are needed to undertake the  counters  measure.    What  resources  are  presently  available  and how they can be obtained;
-  A determination of the priority of needed disaster counter measures;
-  A determination of what persons and organizations will be responsible for the various tasks necessary to accomplish the counter measures

Computers  are  not  only  useful  for  sharing  and  analyzing  disaster information, but also for sharing it.  The internet facility may provide strong base for efficient communications in the following measures:

-  Sharing and collecting information about what agencies have responded and what resources they have dispatched.
-  Locating  and  specifying  procedures  for  obtaining  special  disaster resources;
-  Sharing  information  about  the  location,  scope,  and  character  of  the disaster and damage that has resulted;
-  Sharing information about the status of transportation routes facilities, docking and landing sites;
-  Generating and sharing predictions about weather and other expected conditions;
-  Obtaining  information  on  how  to  deal  with  a  specific  hazardous chemical;
-  General electronic mail.

Thus, it is clear that the communication and equipments and procedures used by most emergency agencies are established primarily to deal with information  flow  within  the  organization.    Disasters  care  for  inter  agency communication also. To some extent, it can be facilitated by the availability of inter-agency radio networks. However, the critical information requirements of the various organizations involved in disaster response need to be mutually understood and the responsibility for gathering and disseminating it needs to be made clear.

Significantly,  disasters  pose  problems  for  resource  management.  A prerequisite  to  effective  and  efficient  resource  management  is  an  accurate system  for  overall  analysis  of  the  disaster  situation  and  the  available resources.    Overall,  need,  assessment,  involves  two  major  processes:  (1) situation analysis; and  (2)  resource  analysis.  Situation  analysis  is  the collection of information about the extent and character of the disaster itself and problems that have to be tackled. While resource analysis involves the collection  of  information  about  the  resources  needed  to  be  handled.  The source allocation of disaster resources depends on the task priorities already decided for the response of disaster.

In contrast to most routine emergencies, efficient response in disaster requires  procedures  for  triage  and  casualty  distribution.  Triage  has  been called  the  key  stone  to  mass  causality  management.  The  technique  for assigning priorities for treatment of the injured when resources are limited is called triage.  Generally, attention is given first to those with the most urgent conditions  and  to  those  who  are  the  most  salvageable.  The  triage  is beneficial in disaster response due to the facts: (i) triage separates out those

who need rapid medical care to some life or lives, (ii) by separating out the minor  injuries;  triage  reduces  the  urgent  burden  on  medical  facilities  and organizations, (iii) by providing for the equitable and rationale distribution of  causalities  among  the  available  hospitals.  Triage  reduces  the  burden  on each  to  a  manageable  level,  often  even  to  non-disaster  level.  In  order  to distribute casualties  rationally  among  the hospitals,  capacity  assessment of the existing hospitals, dispensaries and clinics need to be examined.

It is to be  noted  that  convincing  the  public  to  evacuate  areas threatened  by  impending  disaster  is  often  challenging  one.  In  disasters, communication  with  the  public  assumes  new  dimensions  not  present  in routine  emergencies.    Warning  can  be  one  of  the  most  important  types  of disaster communication allowing the recipients to avoid the threat altogether or to significantly lesson its effects. However, people are often reluctant to evacuate the premises stricken by disaster.  There  are  a number  of  reasons why persons hesitate  to  evacuate  in  the  face  of  threatening  disaster.  They may not be convinced that they are actually at risk, they may wish to stay and  protect  their  property,  or  they  may  want  to  assure  the  safety  of  other family  members  and  property  before  leaving.  Those  living  in  disaster threatened  areas  are  more  likely  to  evacuate  if  they  are  encouraged  by invitations from relatives and friends outside.

In  the  impact  area  people  prefer  to  seek  shelter  with  friends  or relatives rather than at public shelters. Importantly, the process of warning is complicated  since  it  requires  the  accomplishment  of  a  number  of  tasks. Jammed telephone lines and circuits as well as traffic congestion, make the process more difficult.

Disaster response and preparedness is most effective when it is built in  to  development  programmes.  In  long  run,  disaster  mitigation  could  be implemented  at  nominal  cost  by  incorporating  them  into  development programmes.  The  expenditure  on  disaster  mitigation  would  reduce  the potential  losses  that  disaster  cause.  Significantly,  urban  planning  urgently begs fundamental conceptual change, with a need for locating urban disaster management  strategies  in  a  holistic framework  embracing  issues  like poverty, provision of institutional support for informal sector activities, over urbanization,  environmental  degradation  and  unchecked  consumerism  etc. A sound, effective  and  people  centric  urban  disaster  management  strategy can  emerge  only  in  the  context  of  a  truly  sustainable,  and  people  centric development paradigm.  Disaster management and mitigation be organized around  local  recovery  efforts.    In  an  integrated  disaster  risk  management approach, activities from  structural interventions to community  based disaster  management,  which  reduces  hazard  and  vulnerability,  should  be coordinated.    It  is  imperative  to  orient  and  train  development  agencies  to integrate  disaster  risk  management  into  the  national  and  local  planning process, thus mainstreaming disaster reduction into development collaboration  among  the  stakeholders  is  a  critical  strategy in disaster reduction.  It enhances complements the respective capabilities of concerned sectors and organizations in the pursuit of development objectives.

## 2. Community Based Disaster Preparedness

Analyses of response to past disasters have highlighted reaching out to the  victims  within  the  critical  period  during  an  emergency  as  a  major requirement  to  protect  people  and  assets.  This  has  resulted  in  developing mechanisms to mitigate disasters at the grassroots level through participation

of  communities.  Communities  being  the  first  responder  and  having  more contextual  familiarity  with  hazards  and  available  resources  are  in  better position in planning and executing immediate rescue and relief actions. In areas that have experienced repeated disasters, the communities are realizing that  they  need  to  work  out  a  plan  to  prevent  losses  and  at  the  same  time enable  faster  recovery  in  the  event  of  an  emergency  situation.  To  convert this realization into an effective plan, they need guidelines which will help them to prepare their own Community Based Disaster Management plans to safeguard lives, livelihood and property.

The Community  Based  Disaster  Preparedness  (CBDP) planning referred to in the following sections pertains to preparedness, mitigation and response plans. The primary goal of CBDP is to reduce vulnerability of the concerned  community  and  strengthen  its  existing  capacity  to  cope  with disasters.  The  approach  of  preparing  the  CBDP  plans  considers  people's participation a necessary pre-requisite for disaster management. By involving the community in the preparedness phase, it not only increases the likelihood  of  coordinated-action  by  the  communities  to  help  in  mitigation disasters  but  also  brings  the  community  together  to  address  the  issue collectively. There are evidence of collective and coordinated action yielding good results and to a great extent it has been effective in lessening the impact of disaster.

In  view  of  the  above,  the  Government  of  India  and  United  Nations Development Programme reviewed various models of CBDP  being conducted in the country. Several entities have been supporting communities in  developing  CBDP.  The  concept  varies;  for  some,  CBDP  is  getting  the

communities  organized  to  maintain  a  cyclone  structure  and  having  a  well developed  evacuation  plan.  Similarly,  the  process  followed  also  differssome organizations have been developing the plan and explaining the components to the communities; other preferred to develop the plan with the involvement of the communities. Most of these process remained outside the  Government  system  and  it  has  the  inherent  danger  of  communities forgetting the roles and responsibilities, especially if they did not have to use the plan over a period of time.

Preparation of CBDP plans are being promoted under the  GOI-UNDP Disaster  Risk  Management  programme  in  169  districts  in  17  states  by institutionalizing the process within the Government system, with the local authorities playing a dominant role in partnership with other key stakeholders.  It  is  a  scientific  approach,  tested  in  some  pilot  states  and covers  all  aspects  of  disaster  management  through  a  process  involving communities  at  risk.  Recently  the  Government  of  India  has  decided  to launch a project in the remaining multi-hazard regions of the country.

## 3. Components of CBDP

(a) Disaster Management  Committee: Village Disaster Management Committee  (VDMC)  is  formed  in  each  village  and  it  is  responsible  for initiating disaster preparedness activities. It consists of local elected representatives, grass root level Government  functionaries,  local  NonGovernment Organizations (NGOs)/Community Based Organizations (CBOs),  members  of  youth  groups  such  as  the  National  Service  Scheme (NSS)  and  Nehru  Yuva  Kendra  Sangatan  (NYKS),  women  groups,  youth

club members, grass root level Government functionaries, etc. The size of VDMC is based on the population and need of the villagers. The head of the VDMC takes a lead in mobilizing the community for the preparation of the CBDP plans.

- (b) Review &amp; Analysis of Past Disasters: It refers to prioritizing disasters based  on  its  frequency  and  analysis  of  the  estimated  losses.  This  is  an important  activity  as  it  forms  the  basis  for  preparedness  and  mitigation plans.
- (c) Seasonality Calendar of Disasters: While analyzing the past experience pertaining to various natural disasters, communities develop the seasonality calendar based on the occurrence of disaster events. In the calendar below prepared  by  the  community  show  the  month  of  occurrence  of  the  disaster and month for preparedness and mock drill.

(d) Mapping Exercise: One of the most important activities of the CBDP is the  mapping  of  risk,  vulnerabilities  and  capacities  of  the  village  by  the community  itself  because  it  is  considered  to  be  a  very  simple  and  cost effective tool to collect ground level data. This is done through Participatory Rural  Appraisal  (PRA)  exercise.  Before  the  mapping  exercise  starts,  the community members first discuss among themselves, about the experience of previous disasters they have faced or the disasters they may face in future. It aims to provide a pictorial base to the planning process especially for the semi-  literate  populace  and  ensures  maximum  community  involvement across  gender,  caste  and  other  divides.  It  has  also  been  found  to  be  very effective in raising awareness among the community and thereby enhancing

participation of the community in problem identification. The maps generate awareness among the community about the avenues for smooth evacuation during  any  imminent  disaster.  The  strategy  adopted  is  to  use  locally available resources rather than depending on the external agencies for helps and support. The villagers/community members are encouraged to draw the maps on the  ground  using  locally  available  materials  such  as  stone,  stand and  various  colour  powders  for  different  items  and  indicators.  The  maps drawn need not be to scale. The types of maps are as follows:

- · Resource  Map: Resource  mapping  focuses  on  identifying  locally available  assets  and  resources  that  can  be  utilized  for  building  the capacities  of  the  community  during  and  after  disasters.  Apart  from infrastructure and funds, this could be individuals with specific skills, local institutions and people's knowledge as all these have the capacity to  create  awareness  and  bring  about  changes  in  the  community.  A resource map is therefore not limited to a map depicting the available resources  but  also  plotting  of  the  distribution,  access  and  its  use  by taking into consideration prevailing sensitiveness within the village.
- · Risk and Vulnerability Map: In the vulnerability map the community members have to identity the hazards that the  village  is prone  to  and  the  possible  areas  that  would  be  affected.  They  also demarcate the low lying areas, areas near the water bodies such as the sea and river, direction of wind, etc. Through this mapping exercise the community members identify the location of groups at risk and the assets that require protection from various hazards.
- · Safe and Alternate Route Map: In  a  similar  exercise,  the  villagers identify  safe  areas  such  as  strong  houses/buildings,  raised  platforms

etc.  These  act  as  a  shelter  place  for  the  people  in  the  event  of  an evacuation. It would be useful to identify the alternate approach routes which could be used during the time of an emergency.

## (e) Disaster Management Team

Village  level  Disaster  Management  Team  (DMT)/Task  Forces  are formed to outline coordinated response during crisis situations. DMTs have sectoral  focus  such  as  early  warning,  shelter  management,  evacuation  &amp; rescue, medical and first aid, water and sanitation, carcass disposal, counseling,  damage  assessment  and  relief  and  coordination.  Based  on  a needs assessment of the teams, specialized training could be provided to the members. DMT members would be linked to the existing service providers for continuous training and discharging of their responsibilities effectively. The roles and responsibilities of the DMTs are the following:

- 1. Early Warning Team : The members of this team are responsible for providing  latest  warning  information  to  the  villager  so  that  the villagers get ample time to get prepared for the advent of the hazard. At the time of the disaster the members of this team keep a track of the developments. Emergency contact telephone numbers are collected  well  in  advance  of  the  hazard  season,  tools  such  as  radio, television etc. are to be kept in working condition prior to the hazard period.  During  the  occurrence  of  the  event,  the  team  would  be responsible  to  inform  every  household  of  the  latest  position.  They would also keep a track of the situation and listen to the de-warning messages to decide on the timing for calling off the emergency state.

- 2. Evacuation, Search and Rescue Team: Members of this task force are  mainly  responsible  to  evacuate  and  carry  out  search  and  rescue operation during the time of emergency. The members of this team are mainly  young  men  and  women  of  the  village,  ex-service  men; swimmers, etc. Rescue kits necessary to carry out the activities of this team  would  be  ideally made  locally with indigenous materials available. These members are trained with the help of Civil Defense, Police, Fire services etc.
- 3. Shelter Management Team: Members of this team takes care of the identified  shelter  buildings  in  pre,  during  and  post  disaster  scenario. Care  needs  to  be  taken  to  stock  necessary  material  such  as  food, drinking  water,  medicines, bleaching powder,  firewood, lantern,  etc. Special  care  needs  to  be  taken  for  the  animal  stock  during  any disaster. The team needs to ensure hygiene in and around the shelter place.  Women  are  generally  active  members  of  the  shelter  team  as they  are  well  acquainted  with  house  management,  and  are  able  to manage shelter during emergency. The team leader or any other team member should have the keys of the safe shelters so that prior to the disaster they will clean up the place and make available the necessary materials  like  food,  water,  medicines,  bleaching  powder,  firewood, lantern, etc. required for the  evacuees during disaster period.
- 4. Water &amp; Sanitation Team: Members of this team ensures availability of safe drinking water and the cleanliness of the village so that  there  is  no  danger  of  epidemics  even  after  the  event.  They  will

make arrangements for storing drinking water and water for cooking and other chores.

- 5. Medical &amp; First Aid Team: This specialized team is responsible for preparing and updating the list of vulnerable population like old and ailing people, pregnant ladies, children etc. They also have to procure the  necessary  medicines  before  the  hazard  season  and  conduct  a routine  check-up  of  the  ailing  people  in  the  village.  They  have  to collect health related information and make the community aware of the  health  measures  to  be  taken  up.  Women  and  existing  health practitioners  of  the  village  are  the  members  of  this  team.  This  team would receive periodic training  from  the  local  medical  (local  health centre) personnel.
- 6. Relief and Coordination Team: This  team  maintains  the  list  of  all household  members  so  that  they  can  arrange  or  procure  sufficient quantity of food materials for each category of people. They are also responsible  for  the  distribution  of  relief  materials.  And  in  the  post disaster period they will make  arrangements for getting relief materials from the Block office. They should have the list of shops/ wholesale dealerships where food grains are available for use during the time of emergency.
- 7. Carcasses Disposal Team: The team is responsible for the clearing of carcasses  (if  any)  after  the  disaster.  They  are  exposed  to  different types of carcasses disposal methods. The team should put in all their effort to check spread of diseases by disposing of the carcasses at the earliest and in the right manner.

- 8. Trauma Counseling Team: The existing relief system does not have any provision for treatment of mental health, which enhances suicidal cases  after  any  major  disaster.  It  has  been  seen  that  most  of  the community members are traumatized due to loss of family members and  assets.  After  the  large  scale  damages,  it  becomes  difficult  for some of the victims to get back to normalcy. In such a situation, the counseling team is responsible for counseling the victims to ease them of their trauma.
- 9. Damage  Assessment  Team: With  things  getting  better  after  the disaster, the damage assessment team carries out an assessment of the damaged  houses,  livelihood  assets  and  crops  etc.  Usually  a  Govt. functionary  from  the  state  Revenue  Department  carries  out  such assessment after a particular period. During this exercise, the damage assessment  team  helps  him/her  in making  a  timely  and  useful assessment.
- (f) Mock Drill: Mock drill is an integral part of the village CBDP plan, as it is  a  preparedness  drill  to  keep  the  community  alert.  Keeping  this  in  view, mock  drills are organized  in all villages to activate the DMTs  and modification  of  the  DM  plan  based  on  the  gaps  identified  during  such exercises. Basically this is a simulation exercise, which if practiced several times, would help in improving the cohesiveness of the community during an emergency.
- (g) Identification of Hazard Specific Mitigation Activities: While developing  the  CBDP,  the  villagers  would  develop  a  mitigation  plan  for

each hazard for long term planning. These could be coastal belt plantation, cyclone  shelter  in  cyclone  prone  areas,  improved  drainage  system  in  low lying areas,  raising  the  platform  of  the  community  hall  or  school  building etc.  All  mitigation  plans  would  be  forwarded  to  higher  authorities  for financial  provision.  It  helps  the  community  to  minimize  the  loss,  and prevents the impact of various natural disasters. All community mitigation plans are consolidated at Gram Panchayat (GP) level and become the part of the respective GP developmental plan. The mitigation plans would eventually  be  funded  under  the  on-going  development  programmes  in  the district,  for  which  the  District  Magistrate/Collector  is  the  nodal  officer. Disaster management committee at the district levels and the State Steering Committee (a mechanism established at the state headquarters level) play a major role in ensuring this.

h.  Community  Contingency  Fund  (CCF): Availability  of  resources  for various activities to be carried at different phases of the cycle is very crucial. To meet this contingency, each household in the village would be motivated to  contribute  resources  which  could  be  in  the  form  of  funds  and/or  food grains,  which  becomes  the  grain  bank  for  the  village.  A  very  nominal amount based on  the  affording  capacity  of  the  inhabitants  (households)  is collected and kept as the Community  Contingency Fund or village emergency fund. In the annual meeting they decide how to use this fund as per the need and developmental plan of the village.

## 4. Preparation of CBDP Plan-Process

In order to ensure ownership by the community and to ensure reflection of local  conditions  and  sensitiveness,  preparation  of  CBDP  will  have  to  be

through  a  participatory  approach.  Community  based  organizations  and  the NGOs  who  have  been  working  with  communities  are  to  be  identified  to facilitate a PRA exercise. The process followed is listed below:

- (a) Awareness Campaign: A massive awareness campaign is necessary to support  the  community  in  preparation  of  the  disaster  management  plans. These  campaign  are  carried  out  through  various  means  like  rallies,  street plays, competitions in schools, distribution of IEC materials, wall paintings on  do's  and  don'ts  for  various  hazards.  Meetings  with  key  persons  of  a village  such  as  the  village  head,  health  worker,  school  teachers,  elected representatives and members of the youth clubs and women also motivate the villagers to carry forward these plans for a safer living.
- (b)  Training  of  Gram  Panchayat/Block  Members: In  several  states  of India Gram Panchayat is the intermediary administrative unit between block and village level, which has a vital link for disaster management activities. It is the responsibility of the Gram Panchayat Disaster Management Committee to supervise and guide the community in this process. Similarly block is the administrative unit that executes all developmental programmes in the  rural  areas,  and  has  a  very  good  linkage  with  upper  level  of administration. Therefore, both levels of functionaries are very important to ensure risk reduction as a part of the development programme. The district level  master  trainers  are  responsible  to  train  the  functionaries  of  GP  and blocks before initiation of the activities at the village level.
- (c)  Identification of Village Volunteers and Training: One of the major objective of CBDP process is to develop a cadre of trained human resources at  community  level  to  carry  out  all  disaster  management  and  mitigation

initiatives. An innovative method is used in this programme to train at least two persons as disaster management volunteers who, after being trained are supporting the community in development of the village disaster management  plan.  These  volunteers  are  selected  by  the  representatives  of local self-Government, block functionaries and CBOs. Most of the volunteers  are  from  local  youth  clubs,  women  self  help  groups  or  from CBOs and belong to the same community.

- (d)  Training  of  PRI  Members: The  three  tier  Panchayat  Raj  System (peoples' representatives) existing in India has laid down responsibilities of elected local Government  officials at various levels. To mainstream CBDP. It  is  suggested  to  involve  PRIs  in  the  process  to  address  the  vulnerability reduction initiatives through the developmental programme because they are responsible  for  the  local  area's  development.  All  PRIs  are  oriented  by  the master trainers on disaster risk management initiatives and encouraged to be involved to reduce the disaster impact. These oriented PRIs would help the trained volunteers and community on disaster preparedness and management. They are vital players in the disaster reduction programme and help to sustain the same.
- (e) Sensitization Meeting at Village/ Community Level: Village sensitization meetings are organized with help of the representative of local self-Government, trained volunteers, local NGOs etc. for the implementation of  disaster  preparedness  and  mitigation  initiatives.  In  some  villages  the communities are ready for disaster management planning and other activities in one meeting or in some places they require more efforts.

## (f)  Women  Participation  in  Community  Based  Disaster  Preparedness:

Women, children and old age people are the most vulnerable groups in any emergency situation and need special attention and support. While preparing the  preparedness  and  response plan of  a village,  importance  is  laid  on  the vulnerability of women and children. It gives equal opportunity to women groups  to  participate  in  the  preparedness  and  mitigation  initiatives  of  the village. Women are encouraged to be the members of shelter management, search  &amp;  rescue  and  first  aid  and  water  and  sanitation  DMTs.  Special trainings such as swimming, first aid etc. are organized to enhance the skills of  women  DMTs  to  perform  their  duties  better  during  the  time  of  an emergency. In formation of DMCs/DMTs, efforts are being given to ensure 30 percent membership for women to improve the local level planning and response process. This would also provide equal opportunities to show their capability, sincerity and dedication.

## 5. Linkages with Development Programmes:

The  GOI-UNDP  Disaster  Risk  Management  programme  primarily focuses institutionalization of the CBDP process. While external support is being  provided  to  facilitate  the  plan  preparation,  the  plans  become  an integral part of the Government's development agenda. At the village level, the disaster seasonality calendar prepared by the communities indicates the appropriate timing for conducting mock drills, which helps the community and  authorities  to  remind  various  groups  their  roles  and  responsibilities. Some of the measures that are being promoted to ensure sustainability and institutionalization are as follow:

- · Approval of DM plan by the Development Committee at district level to mainstream the vulnerability reduction activities.  All  DM  plans  are  the integral part of the developmental plan of villages as per the Government instruction.
- · DM  plan, DMC  and  DMTs  are recognized by the Government institutions as an integral part of the disaster preparedness and mitigation process.
- · Priority is given to the need of the area while developing the development plan of the Gram Panchayat by the community. Utilisation of  GP  fund  for  mitigation  activities  and  capacity  building  of  DMTs  is encouraged. Special provision for disaster preparedness activities is being made in fund allocation by the Government at various levels.
- · It is the  Gram  Panchayats'  responsibility  to  guide  the  villagers  on development of disaster preparedness plan and after its completion on the compilation  of  all  village  plans  at  the  GP  level.  In  a  similar  way  GP Mitigation  Plans are consolidated at block  level, which  ultimately become the block mitigation plan. Now Gram Panchayats are responsible for development programme as well as disaster management progrmme. Thus the govt. has decentralized the process of disaster preparedness and mitigation.
- · The existing  government  service  providers  are  used  for  up  grading  the knowledge  and skills of GP  DMTs  and  village DMTs.  Training institutions are strengthened for a comprehensive training programme of DMCs and DMTs before the hazard season.
- · Trained volunteers,  CBOs  and  NGOs  are  based  at  grass  root  level  and make the process sustainable.

The  process  of  preparation  of  CBDP  plans  through  a  participatory process, institutionalization of risk management as well as linking it to the overall developmental planning process could be ensured only with capacity enhancement of the stakeholders. Simultaneously, there is a need to create large scale awareness about various options of development process which reduces risks. These cannot be a one-time activity. The chart below outlines some of the essential tools at various stages that would ensure sustainability of community based disaster management.

The 74th Amendment Act of the Constitution opened a new chapter in the  process  of  decentralized  governance.    The  Uttar  Pradesh  Local  Self Government Laws (Amendment) Act, 1994 was passed in May, 1994.  The changes  in  relation  to  the  Conformity  Act  were  mainly  in  composition  of municipalities, reservation, election process, functional domain, and devolution  of  powers  and  finances.    Besides  the  civic  services  functions, municipalities  being  local  governments  also  perform  several  statutory  and regulatory roles which strictly do not fall within their own functional domain but fall within the functional domain of state government.  In the state all the functions  as  envisaged  by  the  Twelfth  Schedule  are  being  performed  by urban local bodies except the functions as enurmated at item No.1, 2, 3 and 7 of  twelfth  Schedule.    Significantly,  the  state  has  formulated  a  strategy  of introducing  innovative  Policy  and  legislative  changes  and  implementing multifaceted institutional and financial capability building reforms for urban local bodies.

In  the  state  of  Uttar  Pradesh  flood  damages  have  been  heavy  and increasing, both dimensionally and impact wise.  The eastern Uttar Pradesh is  flood  prone  area  and  witnesses'  regular  floods,  causing  severe  losses  to crops, cattle, human lives and properties (Table 12.4 &amp; 12.5).

Even droughts adversely affect to the farmers in Bundelkhand and eastern Uttar  Pradesh.    The  typical  courses  of  floods  are  well  known  viz.  heavy precipitation, rising river bed levels, inadequate capacity of water courses to contain  high  flood  flows  the  cutting  of  hill  sides  for  development  works, reckless  construction  of  buildings  and  settlements  in  vulnerable  areas, landslides, poor drainage etc.

On the basis of the Vulnerability Atlas prepared by Building Materials Promotion and Technology Council (BMPTC), Government of India, UNDP and  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  have  identified  199  multi  hazard  prone districts in the country.  These districts fall mainly in Gujarat, Orissa, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Assam,  Meghalaya  and  Sikkim.    However,  there  are  125  most  vulnerable districts falling in Gujarat, Orissa, Bihar, Tamil  Nadu,  West  Bengal, Maharastra,  Delhi,  Uttar  Pradesh,  Uttaranchal,  Assam,  Meghalaya  and Sikkim.  Out of 125 hazard prone districts of India, 13 districts fall in Uttar Pradesh.  These districts are Bahraich, Balrampur, Bijnor, Badaun, Deoria, Ghazipur, Gonda, Gorakhpur, Rampur, Saharanpur, Santkabir Nagar, Sidharth Nagar and Sitapur (Government of India, Vulnerability Atlas).

In the state of Uttar Pradesh, 17879 road accidents were reported in

2004 in which 9463 persons were killed and 12456 persons were injured. It is expected that by the year end of 2011, there will be 19250 road accidents. The economic loss due to road accidents in the state of Uttar Pradesh was estimated  Rs.  8939.5  million  in  2004  which  is  likely  to  increase  in  the coming years (Table 12.6).

The share of road accidents in total accidental fatalities in Agra (82 per  cent),  Lucknow  (78  per  cent),  Varanasi  (53  per  cent),  Meerut  (47  per cent) and Kanpur (42 per cent) is far higher than the all India average (33 per cent). Road accident fatality risk has been reported much higher in the cities of Agra, Meerut, Faridabad, Vijayawada, Jaipur, Lucknow, Vishakhapatnam, Kanpur and Coimbatoor. Fatality risk in U.P. metropolitan cities during 2007 was reported 23.1 which is much higher than the national average of 10.6 (Table 12.7).

Involvement of bicycles and pedestrians in road accidents for some of the selected cities for the year 2005 is shown in Table 22. Pedestrian related accidents are higher compared to bicycles related accidents across all cities. Pedestrian involvement on road accidents range average 20 per cent while bicycles are involved in 5 per cent of the road accidents (Table 12.8).

One of the most crucial needs is the provision of improved rights of way for pedestrians and cyclists. Throughout the world, these non-motorized travelers  are  among  the  most  vulnerable  roadway  users.  Thus,  Western European  cities  generally  provide  them  with  a  wide  range  of  separate facilities  such  as  wide  sidewalks  (pavements),  crosswalks,  cycle  paths, ped/bike traffic signals, intersection modifications (bulb-outs, raised surface, special  lighting),  car-free  zones,  and  traffic-calmed  neighborhoods.  By comparison, Indian government officials and planners have largely ignored non-motorists- although they account for about half of all trips made-and thus expose them to intolerably high levels of traffic danger. It is very rare indeed  to  find  any  special  provisions  for  pedestrians  and  Cyclists.    While narrow  roads,  densely  built  central  cities,  and  lack  of  funding  obviously hinder the allocation of scarce roadway space to cyclists and pedestrians, the real problem is government priorities that favor motorized traffic. Since the powerful  elite  are  more  likely  to  drive  private  cars,  they  have  strongly favored  highway  projects  over  improvements  for  pedestrians  and  cyclists. Policy makers rarely consider the needs of the non-motorized urban poor.

Thus, it is clear that the communication  and equipments and procedures  used  by  most  emergency  agencies  are  established  primarily  to deal with information flow within the organization.  Disasters care for inter agency  communication  also.  To  some  extent,  it  can  be  facilitated  by  the availability of inter-agency radio networks. However, the critical information  requirements  of  the  various  organizations  involved  in  disaster response need to be mutually understood and the responsibility for gathering and disseminating it needs to be made clear.

In  the  impact  area  people  prefer  to  seek  shelter  with  friends  or relatives rather than at public shelters.  Importantly, the process of warning is  complicated  since  it  requires  the  accomplishment  of  a  number  of  tasks. Jammed telephone lines and circuits as well as traffic congestion, make the process more difficult.

## BUILDING A NEW TECHNO-LEGAL REGIME

Building  Regulations/Bye-laws  provide  the  mandatory  techno-legal framework for regulating building activity from planning, design to completion of construction. Mainly such laws are State Legislations as the State  is  competent  to  legislate  and  make  laws  on  such  subjects.  However, where  the  Central  Government  is  to  legislate  on  such  subjects  and  where Parliament is to make law in this behalf such legislations are applicable in the  Union  Territories.  Central  laws  are  advisory  and  recommendatory  in nature. Taking this legislation as Model, other State Governments formulate the  rules  and  regulations  with  the  help  of  local  bodies,  under  the  various legislations.  After  the  approval,  the  concerned  local  bodies  enforce  these rules  and  regulations  pertaining  to  development  and  building  standards  as building regulations/building bye-laws in their respective areas.

## Authorities for Controlling Development

To regulate the growth of urban areas, the State Governments notify areas  for  planned  growth  under  certain  laws.  These  are  notified  under relevant  Planning  and  Development  Act. State  Government  formulates  the rules  and  regulations  with  the  help  of  the  local  bodies  under  the  various legislations.  After  the  approval,  the  concerned  local  bodies  enforce  these rules  and  regulations  pertaining  to  development  and  building  standards  as building regulations/building bye-laws in their respective areas.

## Central Legislation/Guidelines

Model Town and Country Planning Act, 1960

The Town and Country Planning Organization (TCPO), which is an organization  of  Central    Government  to  deal  with  the  subject  of  planning (regional, urban and rural) and developmental policies, formulated a Model Town and Country Planning Act in the year 1960. The Model Act provides as follows:

- a. Provision  for  preparation  of  comprehensive  Master  Plan  for  urban areas  of  various  states.  The  states  may  adopt  the  Model  legislation with suitable modifications for this purpose.
- b. To  constitute  a  Board  to  advise  and  to  coordinate  in  the  matter  of planning  and  plan  formulation  by  the  Local  Planning  Authorities  in the State.
- c. Provisions  for  implementation  and  enforcement  of  the  Master  Plans the  miscellaneous  provisions  to  achieve  planned  urban  growth  of various urban areas in the state.

## National Building Code

National Building Code prepared by the Bureau of Indian Standards in 1970  and  subsequent  revisions  are  advisory  in  nature  and  not  mandatory. The  various  provisions  in  the  Codes  are  framed  by  a  panel  of  experts keeping other standards in view. It lays down a set of minimum provisions designed  to  protect  the  safety  of  the  public  with  regard  to  structural sufficiency, fire hazards and health aspects in buildings. So long these basic requirements  are  made,  the  choice  of  materials,  methods  of  design  and construction  is  left  to  the  ingenuity  of  the  architect  and  the  engineers  and

other  experts  engaged  in  such  projects.  The  code  also  covers  aspects  of administrative requirements and bye-laws including building services.

## State Level Legislation

The  planning  and  development  are  mainly  the  State  subjects  and therefore, the development in the State is based on the legislative support as applicable in that State. The legislative support in the state is applicable to formulate Master Plans, Zonal Plan, Development Plans and Development Schemes and for their implementation and enforcement.

## Legislative Support at the Local Level

At the local level, the Municipal Authorities and Panchayat regulate the development/construction of building through the building regulation/building bye-laws as followed in their respective areas. The State Government from time to time issues directions/guidelines for safety against natural hazards, which are followed by local bodies while granting permission for construction of buildings/structures.

## Initiative Taken to Strengthen Legislative Framework

The  State  Government  have  based  their  legislation,  regulation  and bye-laws on the guidelines issued by the Central Government. Post disaster studies  of  some  of  the  devastating  earthquakes  like  Uttarkashi  Earthquake (M-6.6) in October 1991, Killari earthquake (M-6.3) 1993, Chamoli Earthquake  (M-6.8)  in  March  1999  and  Kutchch  Earthquake  (M-6.9)  in January 2001 showed the need for planning and engineering intervention in

development plan, design and construction of buildings to make them strong enough to withstand the impact of natural hazards and to impose restrictions on land use  so  that  the    exposure  of  the  society  to  the  hazard  situation  is avoided or minimized. Due to lack of adequate or no land sue restrictions in the hazard prone areas in the town and country planning laws, Master Plan rules  or  bye-laws,  cities  tend  to  expand  in  all  directions,  occupying  even most  vulnerable  areas  resulting  in  vulnerability  of  more  and  more  areas getting threatened by natural hazards. Realizing this urgent need was felt for establishing a proper techno-legal regime through appropriate provisions for safety against natural hazards.

The  Expert  Committee  constituted  by  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs studied  the  existing  guidelines  Acts,  Regulations,  Development  Control Rules and Bye-laws and prepared a Model Building Regulations to enable the States in Seismic Zones III, IV and V (based on M. M. Intensities VII, VIII  and IX or more respectively) to adopt them for safety against natural hazards.  Recommendations  for  amendment  in  Model  Town  &amp;  Country Planning Act, 1960 and Model Regional &amp; Town Planning and Development law, 1985 cover the following aspects:

-  Addition  of  definition  of  Natural  Hazard,  Natural  Hazard  Prone Areas, Natural Disaster and Mitigation
-  To keep in view natural hazard proneness in preparation of Development Plans by Local Planning Authorities
-  Due consideration  to  follow  the  Regulations  pertaining  to  Land  use Zoning and necessary protection measures in perspective and Development Plan of State, district and local planning areas
-  Existing map(s) to indicate hazard provisions of the areas

## Regulations for Land Use Zoning for Natural Hazard Prone Areas

The regulations for land use zoning for natural hazard prone areas are notified under  Town  and  Country  Planning  Act  as  applicable  in  the respective  States  as  and  when  Master  Plan/Development  Plan  of  different cities/towns/areas are formulated. These zoning regulations are implemented through  the  provisions  of  Development  Control  Regulation/Building  Byelaws, wherever the Master Plan are not in existence or not formulated.

Classification of urban land use is based on the sequences of various plans as shown below:

Perspective Plan -

Policy document

Development Plan -

Comprehensive plan indicating use of each Parcel of land

Layout of Projects -         For detailed layout of projects/schemes

The  main  purpose of the land use zoning is to provide regulations for development of a particular area to serve the desired purpose efficiently and to  preserve  its  character.  It  also  provides  for  the  kind  of  buildings  to  be constructed.  Zoning regulations  are legal tools  for  guiding  the  use  of  land and  protection  of  public  health,  welfare  and  safety.  Such  regulations  also include  provisions  for  the  use  of  premises/property  and  limitations  upon shape, size and type of buildings that are constructed. or occupy the land. These  provide  both  horizontal  as  well  as  vertical  use  of  land  and  also improve the quality of life in urban areas.

This includes:

- · Definition  of  natural  hazard,  natural  hazard  prone  areas,  natural disaster, mitigation.

- · Identification of natural hazard prone areas with respect to earthquakes, cyclones, floods and landslides
- · Specific recommendations for land use zoning for earthquake, landslide, cyclones and flood areas
- · Protection measures of building of essential services and installations from natural hazards in hazard prone areas
- · Prioritization of types of building for land use zoning:
- (i) Defense installation, industries, public utilities, life line structures  like  hospitals,  electricity  installations,  water  supply, telephone exchange, aerodromes and railway stations; commercial  centers,  libraries,  other  buildings  or  installations with contents of high economic value.
- (ii) Public  and  Semi  Public  institutions,  Government  offices,  and residential areas.
- (iii) Parks  play  grounds,  wood  lands,  gardens,  green  belts,  and recreational areas.
- · Regulation for land use zoning shall be an over riding effect on any other regulation.
- · For any relaxation, adoption of safe guard and protective measures to the satisfaction of the Competent Authority will be incumbent on the part of user.
- · Additional  provisions  with  regard  to  land  use  zoning  for  natural hazard areas are suggested in Model Planning Legislation.

State Governments have been advised to suitably incorporate the modification in their respective Planning Legislation (s), so that regulation

for  land  use  zoning  for  natural  hazard  prone  areas  may  be  notified  by  the competent authority under the above legal provision.

## Additional Provisions in Development Control Regulations

Development Control Regulations and Bye-laws

To regulate development within the framework of a development plan regulation, known as development promotion regulation prescribed as a part of the development plan. The basic purpose of such regulations is to promote quality of life of people by organizing the most appropriate development of land  in  accordance  with  the  developmental  policies  and  the  land  use proposals contained therein.

- · Registration  preferred -Registration, qualification and  duties of professional defined.
- · In order to bring professionalism in all development and construction work,  especially with  respect to safety against natural hazards, registration  of  the  following  professionals  have  been  recommended mandatory requirement.
- (i) Structural  engineer  -  qualification  and  experience  defined  on the     basis of types and importance of structures
- (ii) Engineers
- (iii) Construction Engineer (RCE)
- (iv) Construction Management Agency-owner shall be a RCE
- (v) Quality Auditor
- (vi) Architect
- (vii) Geotechnical Agency
- (viii) Town Planner

## (ix) Developer

- · The owner/developer shall appoint the professionals from the registered  professionals  from  the  registered  professionals  and  will submit  a  list  of  professionals  on  Record  with  the  application  for development permission to the Competent Authority.
- · Indication of designation and registration number of each professional on every plan, document prepared by him/her made compulsory.
- · Structural  engineer  on  Record  and  Architect  on  Record  shall  be responsible for adhering to the provision of the relevant and prevailing Indian Standards.
- · Procedure for securing Development Permission requires certificate of undertaking in the prescribed form by the Owner, Developer, Structural Engineer on Record and Architect on Record and Construction Engineer on Record regarding the mandatory application of all structural safety  regulations  including  safety  from  natural hazards in both design and construction of the buildings.
- · Adequate protection clause for land liable to liquefaction, storm surge and landslide.
- · For adequate record and checking compulsory submission of detailed working  drawing/structural  drawing  along  with  soil  investigation report before the commencement of the work.
- · For  Structural  Design  details  of  various  National  Standards/Codes relating to structural safety from natural hazards as listed below have been included for guidance of the professionals to design the structures/buildings,  keeping  in  view  the  provision  of  such  codes against different hazards.

## Structural Design Basis Report

To  ensure  the  compliance  of  various  codes,  Structural  Engineer  on Record is required to submit Structural Design Basis Report in prescribed proforma  for  applicable  type  of  structure.  Design  Basis  Report  format  for Load Bearing Buildings. Reinforced concrete framed building and structural steel,  interalia,  include  essential  elements  of  design  required  for  safety against hazard. In compliance of the design with the above Indian Standard, the  Structural  Engineer  on  Record  will  submit  a  Structural  Design  Basis Report in the prescribed Proforma covering the essential safety requirements specified in the Standard.

## Seismic Strengthening of Existing Building

Prior  to  seismic  strengthening/  retrofitting  of  any  existing  structure, evaluation of the existing structure as regards structural vulnerability in the specified  wind/  seismic  hazard  zone  shall  be  carried  out  by  a  Registered Structural Engineer (RSE) / Registered Structural Design Agency (RSDA). If as per the evaluation of the RSE / RSDA the seismic resistance is assessed to be less than the specified minimum seismic resistance in the note below, action will be initiated to carry out the upgrading of the seismic resistance of the building as per applicable standard guidelines.

## CHAPTER-14

## AGENCIES INVOLVED IN DISASTER RESPONSE

## Bilateral Organizations

The European Union is the world's biggest donor of humanitarian aid, which  comprises  of  assistance,  relief  and  protection  operations.  Such  aid includes operations in preparation for, and the prevention of disasters. The activities of the European Commission (EC) are coordinated through various mechanisms in partnership with NGOs and the specialized agencies of the United Nations.

The  three mechanisms  through  which  the  EC  operates  are  the European  Community  Humanitarian  Office  (ECHO),  Food  Aid  and  Food Security support operations, and Rehabilitation and Reconstruction operations. The EC finances disaster prevention, mitigation, and preparedness in response to requests from NGOs  and international organizations. Long-term development in areas affected by disasters has also been undertaken.

## DFID

The British Government's Development for International Department provided a huge and ponds through Christian Aid for emergency assistance to 10,000 flood-affected families in Northern India. In addition, DFID also

provided support to the International Federation of the  Red Cross and Red Crescent  Societies  for basic emergency  assistance  to  a  large  number beneficiaries for up to three months. DFID is also funding Oxfam's Northeast India flood response proposal, and providing support to a cyclone relief programme in West Bengal.

## USAID

In  the  majority  of  cases,  USAID  does  not  involve  itself  in  disaster relief  other  than  monitoring  and  reporting  on  disaster  preparedness  and response activities. There may, however, be provision through partner NGOs for short-term food aid to disaster victims. In the event of a major disaster, or  when  the  US  Government  is  requested/warranted,  it  is  the  duty  of  the Mission Disaster  Relief Office to ensure that there is a adequate pre-disaster preparedness and response plan, to advise the ambassador on the mode of US  participation  desirable,  and  to  coordinate  disaster  relief  operations  as approved by the ambassador.

## Multilateral Organizations

## World Bank

The  World  Bank's  (WB)  Disaster  Management  Facility  (DMF)  was established to mainstream disaster prevention and mitigation initiatives into all its activities. The DMF has, therefore, undertaken the Market Incentives for Mitigation Investment project aimed at promoting market incentives for risk reduction. India has been selected for a pilot study for the following:

- · Disaster  loss  experience  and  vulnerability  to  sudden  and  slow  onset disasters.
- · Institutional and regulatory structure: regulations related to natural for the insurance industry.
- · Structure  of  the  insurance  sector  for  casualty  insurance:  primary  and reinsurance.
- · Role  of  the  insurance  sector  in  motivating  mitigation  investment,  riskbased premium, and public education.
- · Role of public policy to support the insurance industry in mitigation.
- · The role of the global reinsurance industry in risk reduction.
- · The role of International Financial Institutions (IFIs) in risk reduction.

Between June and December 1996, heavy rains, floods and cyclones killed 1,689  people  in  the  subcontinent  and  caused  an  estimate  US$  2  billion  in damage. In late November 1996, the State Government of Andhra Pradesh requested  the  WB's  assistance  in  the  recovery  efforts.  To  ensure  the sustainability  of  the  State's  future  development,  the  focus  of  the  WB's assistance has been to provide long-term disaster mitigation capability across the  state. The  project  has  an  estimated  cost  of  US$  220  million.  Its objectives are to assist the State Government of Andhra Pradesh in preparing and implementing a hazard management programme in high risk areas; and restoring public infrastructure according to hazard resistance criteria and to enhance the early warning capacity of the Government of India.

Following the 1993 Latur earthquake, the WB  undertook a rehabilitation  project  to  assist  with  reconstruction,  increase  the  earthquake resistance of buildings and  infrastructure through  the  development  of

improved standards for design and construction and to develop the ability of the  state  of  Maharastra  to  plan  for  and  manage  disasters.  The  project's estimated  cost  is  US$  328  million  and  its  most  important  focus  is  the development of long-term disaster management capacity in the state.

## WHO

In 1995, an Emergency and Humanitarian Action unit was established at WHO's South East Asia Regional Office in New Delhi. Its goal is to provide assistance  to  the  member  states  in  developing  and  strengthening  their emergency prevention,  preparedness,  mitigation  and  response  programmes and to promote national self-reliance, The ERA also acts to strengthen the Regional  Officer's  emergency  prevention,  preparedness,  mitigation  and response  programmes  and  to  provide  emergency  assistance  upon  request from the member states. With each of the member states, the until will focus on:

- · National health policy and legislation
- · Planning, emergency preparedness and management
- · Community-based emergency preparedness and management
- · Emergency information system
- · Human  resource  development  and  institutionalization,  based  on  a multi-sectorial approach.

## UNDP

UNDP has been operating in India for 50 years. Its agreement with the Government  of  India  does  not  allow  it  to  participate  in  relief  operations

unless  specially  requested.  However,  development  programmes  are  often initiated  following  a  disaster.  The  concept  of  disaster  preparedness  and management  has  been  incorporated  into  its  development  programmes, particularly after the 1993 Latur earthquake.

Although  not  involved  in  immediate  disaster  relief,  UNDP  receives information on the extent of disaster damage and loss of life. Following the recent floods in West Bengal, UNDP was part of a joint agency mission to the  Malda  district  to  assess  the  damage  and  the  response  of  UN  agencies. The focus on incorporating disaster management training and preparedness into development reflects the newfound awareness that disaster planning has on large-scale development.

To  strengthen  the  national  capacity  to  mitigate,  prevent  and  manage crises,  UNDPs  Emergency  Response  Division  sponsors  activities  in  two areas. The first is preventive development, which includes:

- · Assessing vulnerability to crises and natural disasters
- · Establishing early warning systems
- · Developing  and  maintaining  a  framework  of  development  responses and other contingency disaster plan to be used if a crisis erupts
- · Forming and strengthening UN Disaster Management Teams
- · Integrating  disaster  preparedness,  mitigation,  prevention  and  response programmes into national development  programmes
- · Identifying and engaging the services of consultants to be placed at the disposal of the Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator in crisis situations

- · Preparing National Human Development Reports.
- The  Second  activity  is  training in order  to contribute  to human
- resources development by improving capabilities in:
- · Risk and vulnerability analyses
- · Planning for contingencies
- · Designing responsive structures
- · Implementing  prevention  and  mitigation  strategies  for  disaster  and crises.

The  training  is  provided  through  the  Disaster  Management  Training Programme to personnel from the Government, NGOs, community leaders, and  partners  in  the  United  Nations.  UNDP  expects  to  deliver  US$  200 million in development oriented assistance between 1997 and 2001.

## UNICEF

UNDP has  a  long-term  presence  in  India  with  a  strong  field-based structure. Through its state offices, UNICEF is able to respond quickly and flexibly to disaster situations. Its response is subject to being requested by the Government of India (which has not asked for outside help since 1974). Thus,  UNICEF  can  only  help  by  donating  funds  to  the  Prime  Minister's Relief Fund, an avenue that it feels inappropriate.

However, requests from the state or district levels enable UNICEF to provide disaster assistance. When a disaster occurs, US$ 10,000is immediately made available. In many cases, disaster relief is an extension of an  ongoing  programme  (for  instance,  drinking  water  programmes  may  be altered to incorporate the bleaching of wells contaminated during a flood).

UNICEF produced four flood situation reports and also examined how children  were  severely  traumatized  during  the  floods.  The  fragmented response  of  the  Government,  the  United  Nations,  and  NGOs  is  a  major concern of UNICEF. It is, therefore, meeting with the Government in order to facilitate a more coordinated disaster response mechanism.

## UNHCR

The  two  main  functions  of  UNHCR  are  to  provide  international protection to refugees, and to seek permanent solutions to refugee problems. UNHCR first established its office in New Delhi in February 1969 to assist the  100,000  Tibetan  refugees  in  India.  It  has  since  provided  assistance  to over 10 million refugees from Bangladesh, 50,000 refugees from Afghanistan,  as  well  as  assisted  the  Government  of  India  to  repatriate  Sri Lankan  refugees  from  Tamil  Nadu.  UNHCR  provides  limited  financial assistance,  since  it  would  prefer  to  help  refugees  become  self-reliant.  It encourages able-bodied refugees to participate in income generating activities and is further investigating the possibility of micro-credits, cooperatives, and community development activities.

## CARE India

CARE India is committed to respond to mitigate human suffering and loss  of  support  systems  in  disaster  situations.  CARE  works  closely  with national  and  state  Governments,  generally  responding  to  disasters  at  their request,  and its  relief  and  development  interventions  aim  at  improving the socioeconomic  conditions  of  the  poor.  CARE  activates  its  Emergency

Response  Unit  at  its  headquarters  in  Delhi,  a  State  Emergency  Response Team at the state level, and an On-Site Emergency Response Coordinator.

Its organizational  structural  allows  it  to  implement  both  regular development  and  emergency  work  down  to  the  community  level.  CARE India is also the convener of the Government of India NGO Committee on Emergency Preparedness.

## IFRC

The  IFRC  is the world's largest humanitarian organization. Its mission,  broadly  speaking,  is  to  improve  the  situation  of  the  world's  most vulnerable people. The IFRC is represented in India through its South Asian Regional Delegation.

Over  the  past  two  years,  the  Federation  has  actively  supported  and jointly  carried  out  a  series  of  Regional  Disaster  Preparedness  Workshops with the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS). Its Regional Progamme Manager has been involved in this training since august 1997 and will continue till the end of 1999, by which time the IRCS is slated to have developed sufficient expertise and ownership to carry on this training with little or no expatriate involvement.

The implementation is being shared by IRCS, the Federation and the International  Committee  for  the  Red  Cross  (ICRC).  The  Federation  will support a three year training initiative to the IRCS staff and to volunteers in disaster preparedness, risk management, hazard identification, vulnerability, and  community  capacity  analysis.  These  workshops  will  enable  staff  to

conduct  their  own  sub-branch  and  village-based  training  events  and  apply the  skills  to  disaster  situations.  District  plans  will  gradually  be  developed from the vulnerability and community capacity analyses. This database will provide  the  foundation  for  a  state  level  and,  eventually,  national  level, disaster preparedness plan.

## ICRC

Although the ICRC has been operating in India for the past 50 years, its  South Asian regional office was established in New Delhi in 1982. The ICRC has responded to  several  conflict  in  the  region,  including  the  IndoPakistan conflict (1948), assisting Tibetan  refugees (1959), the IndoPortuguese conflict (1960-1), the Sino-Indian conflict (1962-3), the second Indo-Pakistan  conflict  (1965-6)  and  the  Indo-Pakistan/Bangladesh  conflict (1971).

Recently,  the  ICRC  has  become  increasingly  involved  in  working with the victims of internecine conflict, such as, in the case of prisoners in Jammu and Kashmir, and violence against Dalits. Here, the ICRC's mandate is  to  ensure  the  fair  and  proper  treatment  of  prisoners,  which  therefore interdicts its involvement in long-term development projects: natural disaster response  is  more  the  responsibility  of  the  Indian  Red  Cross  Society, although the ICRC provides support where necessary. During emergencies priority  is  given  to  the  treatment  and  evacuation  of  the  injured,  especially those in the more marginalized groups-women and children. In South Asia, the ICRC's  'tracing services' forwarded  more  than  16  million  family messages and opened 20,000 inquiries to trace missing family members. In

this region, the Committee operates on an annual budget of Swiss Franc 8 million.

## IRCS

The Indian Red Cross Society was founded in 1920. It follows its own established disaster plan, the most basic being disaster relief. Through some 650  branches,  the  IRCS  provides  a  well-knit  and  well-organized  network countrywide. In the event of a disaster, the services of the Red Cross become auxiliary  and/or  complementary  to  that  of  the  Government.  The  district committee  of  the  affected  area  immediately  goes  into  action  by  initiating disaster  relief  operations.  The  state  branch  reinforces  these  efforts  and informs the national headquarters of the situation, of the services, the quality and type of materials required. There is close cooperation with the Government and other NGOs.

## CHAI

The  Catholic  Health  Association  of  India  is  the  world's  largest voluntary  healthcare organization.  Its  disaster  response  is  characterized  by 'holistic health through people's empowerment'. Following the Latur earthquake in 1993, CHAI not only provided relief but supported an ongoing development process to lead to people's self reliance and liberation'. CHAI's first priority was to provide relief: it established one of the first health camps in  the  area.  It  also  insured  that  its  activities  were  not  in  competition  with those of other relief organizations, but rather filled in the gaps.

CHAI's main priorities are to provide medical aid and healthcare; concentrate on physical, social, emotional, and spiritual rehabilitation; attend to  hygiene  and  sanitation;  mobilize  relief  material  for  villages;  and  create economic development programmes that assist in returning to normalcy.

## VHAI

VHAI  links  4,000  health  and  developmental  organizations  across India through State Voluntary Health Associations. Its goal is to make health a reality for the people of India'. VHAI's long-term major objectives are the promoting social justice  and human rights  in  health  service, building  up  a people's  health  movement,  and  advocating  a  cost-effective,  preventive, promotive and sustainable healthcare system. At the macro level, VHAI acts jointly  with  health-planners,  policymakers,  parliamentarians,  activists,  and other leading health organizations. At the micro level, it maintains grassroots contact through programmes designed to respond to local needs, receiving feedback  from  the  field  about  its  concepts  on  community  health  and suggestions about the organization's future direction.

## CASA

CASA has been involved in relief and development since 1947, when the Government of India requested the Church to help provide relief to the Partition's  refugees.  CASA  established  the  Committee  on  Relief  and  Gift Supplies (CORAGS), and later extended its relief operations to victims of natural disasters.

In  1972,  CASA became independent of the National Council of Churches and re-orientated itself towards development and disaster mitigation. Throughout the 1980s, emergency relief gradually dovetailed with development activity, and disaster preparedness became an integral part of the development progress. This involved community interaction and empowerment,  ensuring  in  times  of  calamity  the  community's  capacity  to help itself, rather than promoting a relief psychology.

Disaster Management Training programmes, a close association with the  Government,  and  a  strong  network  within  the  Church  and  among grassroots NGOs has allowed CASA to pool resources and expertise from various sectors to provide a holistic approach to development and disaster mitigation, preparedness and relief.

## EFICOR

EFICOR  is  a  Church-based  organization  that  provides  relief  to  all communities during times of calamity and supports long term development programmes. EFICOR's first response was to the 1971 Bihar famine, with its primary  role  that  of  a  'welfare  organization  responding  to  need'.  In  the 1980's,  a  review  of  the  effectiveness  of  EFLICOR's  response  reoriented  it towards  long  term  development  programmes  and  disaster  preparedness. EFICOR still involves itself in disaster relief, responding to 30-35 disaster situations  a  year,  but  in  a  supplemental  capacity  to  the  efforts  of  the Government and other NGOs.

When a disaster occurs, a member from EFICOR's Disaster Management Unit goes to the affected area to assess where it can 'fill the

gaps'  of  the  relief  effort.  The  organization  outlays  Rs  1.5-2  lakhs  for immediate disaster assistance. In workshops held twice a year, participants from  partner  NGOs  are  brought  to  a  previously  disaster  affected  area  to teach  them  to  assess  how  relief  was  administered  and  to  evaluate  the redevelopment programme.

## Action Aid

Action  Aid  has  been  involved  in  India  since  1972  and  'exists  to facilitate the empowerment of the poor in the process of social development.' Recognising that long- term development is where its core competence lies, Action Aid, through local NGOs, supports long term (8-12 years) development  programmes,  with  the  aim  of  making  the  community  selfsufficient and improving the life of the  marginalized.

Action  Aid  has  also  perceived  any  involvement  in  disaster-related work as another process perpetuating poverty. However, venturing into the heartland of poverty in India-which is also prone to disasters- it has had to develop  strategies  to  systematically  deal  with  disasters.  In  this  context, Action Aid has recently produced an Emergency Strategy Paper.

## NOVIB

NOVIB  was  founded  in  the  Netherlands  in  1956.  The  devastating floods in Holland in the early 1950s which killed over 2,000 people and the ensuring  humanitarian  aid  from  the  rest  of  the  world  prompted  secular philanthropists to found NOVIB.

Country operation is South Asia, particularly in India, began during late 1970s  in  the  form  of  supporting  relief-rehabilitation,  basic  needs satisfaction,  and  food  security  programmes  like  'food  for  work'.  NOVIB started the disaster relief-related work in India following the 1977 cyclone along the AP coast.

NOVIB's  disaster/emergencies-related  work  is  primarily,  but  not exclusively, with the direct target group with whom its partner NGOs works. For example, it participated in the Latur earthquake relief work through its partner NGO Manavlok, the flood relief programme in the Tirunelveli and Nagercoil  districts  through  partner  NGOs  like  the  Centre  for  Appropriate Technology (CAT) and the Centre for Rural Technology (CRT), and the AP cyclone relief programme through Oxfam Hyderabad (1997-8). In the past, NOVIB's  work  has  been  emergency  response  rather  than  preparedness.  It seeks  to  provide  immediate  relief  such  as  food,  cloth,  temporary  shelter, health  resources,  compliment  the  work  of  Government  and  other  local institutions in long-term rehabilitation, and strengthens the capacities of the communities  to  have  access  to  local  resources,  and  adopt  appropriate technologies and influence policies.

Currently, the disaster /relief programmes are handled by one person in  NOVIB's  International  Bureau  in  close  cooperation  with  the  respective country  programme  officers.  NOVIB  and  Oxfam  are  also  working  to develop a policy framework and protocol regarding emergency relief.

There  have  been  no  separate  allocations  for  Indian  on  the  issue  of emergencies. NOVIB's annual budget for India for the past three years has been about 8 million Dutch Guilders (roughly Rs 160 million, at the current

exchange  rate),  with  most  of  it  earmarked  for  direct  structural  poverty alleviation programmes. Its total for emergency relief/rehabilitation expenditure in India during the past three years is about Rs 25 million.

## CARITAS India

CARITAS  India,  operating  in  India  since  1962,  is  a  development organization of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India. Initially, CARITAS focused on providing relief to the poor and suffering, especially during times of calamity. However, this approach was deemed unsatisfactory and the thrust of its involvement shifted toward developing skills to enable higher income generation. Although effective, this approach was also found wanting  as  it  benefited  only  those  without  it  were  further  marginalized. CARITAS,  therefore,  redeployed  itself  to  target  the  population  as  active participants in the development process rather than as passive recipients of aid.

The people's empowerment is the priority, in keeping with its motto of 'building people  through  building  homes  and  building  homes  through building houses'. During the past five years, CARITAS has released over Rs 439 lakh for relief, rehabilitation and long-term environmental programmes.

## Save the Children

Save the Children began working ink pre-Independence India proving relief  during  emergencies.  The  India  office  was  established  in  1975  to coordinate the existing relief operations to explore new areas and long-term development programmes incorporating disaster mitigation and

preparedness. Relief operations also under-went a review, leading to better assessment  of  disasters  and  the  needs  of  the  people  affected.  Save  the Children  Fund  works  through  partner  NGOs  by  providing  financial  and technical resources and training assistance. It is currently involved with six programmes in 12 states, including child sponsorship and Tibetan refugees. Both these programmes are, however, to be phased out.

## CRS

CRS  has  been  operating  in  India  for  nearly  50  years.  It  is  closely affiliated to USAID  and  has  a  working  partnership  with  the Indian Government. When a disaster occurs, CRS is informed of the relief required by one of its local counterparts and has the capacity to immediately release up to 50 metric tones of food relief supplies, as well as other auxiliary relief resources  such  as  blankets,  tarpaulins  and  cash.  If  the  amount  required exceeds  50  metric  tones,  it  requests  the  US  Government  for  additional resources. CRS,  which  provides  about  US$  350,000  a  year  in food assistance, has an agreement with Indian Government that it be responsible for the transportation of the relief supplies to the affected area.

## LWS

LWS has operated in India since 1974, when it responded to the needs of refugees following the Bangladesh war. LWS has since been implementing relief, rehabilitation and integrated development programmes in several Indian  states, particularly in West  Bengal  and  Orissa.  All

programmes  are  taken  up  at  the  Government's  request  or  on  its  own initiatives in consultation with Government authorities.

LWS  works with disaster response at different levels. Relief operations  are  short  term  initiatives  in  which  disaster  victims  are  given temporary  shelter,  materials  and  food.  Rehabilitation  programmes  assist affected  communities  to  rebuild  damaged  houses,  construct  school-flood shelter,  develop  safe  water  sources,  as  well  as  repair  and  strengthen  other community assets. Disaster preparedness programmes are long-term initiatives to improve the coping capacity of disaster -prone communities.

## Trigger Mechanism

The man has conquered the nature and feels so. The nature on its part shows its fury and takes its tall now and then reminding the mankind to be careful. There are a number of factor, which contribute to the natural disasters in different parts of the world. These can be traced to the process of evolution of the planet earth, impacts of  developmental activities without regeneration to meet endless demands of the man, explosion and concentration of population and changing social pattern of life. The effects of the modern culture are reflected in the global warming, excessive generation  of  heat  energy  and  depletion  of  the  protective  environmental  layer. Whereas  the  natural  disasters  are  the  manifestation  of  the  nature  of  trying  to maintain equilibrium, the man  made  disasters are the fall out of modern developmental activities, levels of human inefficiency and the man's intense desire of being the supreme and unchecked.

As and when a disaster takes place, be it natural or man made, the managers struggle to mitigate its effects on human lives and material losses. The immediate response in all disasters has more or less the same parameters. These are to provide rescue and relief and save the precious human life. Thus, the emergency response of  the  disaster  managers  is  a  factor  independent  of  the  types  of  intensity  of  the disasters.

We already have Contingency Action Plans. The national contingency plan has already been notified. These management plans lay down in detail the activities which are required to be undertaken with reference to the particular disaster. These are  very  exhaustive  management  plans.  However,  these  plans  can  not  put  into operation immediately, as such as, the functional spontaneous mechanism has not been provided, for example who will do what ?

As and when the disasters strike or take place, the managers are required to swing in action  without  losing  time.  Generally,  In  such  situations,  the  managers start organizing planning and activating the mitigation process. On the other hand, the event had already taken place and the need of that hour is to start the mitigation process  and  virtually  no  time  can  be  spared  at  that  stage  for  the  activities  like organizing and planning. Time is the essence of the immediate relief and rescue operations to save human lives and mitigate human miseries for the next 48 to 72 hours.  Therefore,  actually  what  is  required  to  be  done  is  a  part  of  long  term rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes.

The trigger mechanism, therefore, envisages that on receiving signals of a disaster  happening  or  likely  happen,  all  activities  required  for  the  mitigation process are energized and activated simultaneously without loss of any time and the management of the event is visible on the ground. The primary objective of the trigger  mechanism  is  to  undertake  immediate  rescue  and  relief  operations  and stabilize the mitigation process as quickly as possible.

The  trigger  mechanism  in  fact  is  a  preparedness  plan  which  all  the participating  managers,  and  actors,  know  advance the task assigned  to them  and the manner in which they have to be prepared themselves to respond. As such the organization  and  planning  has  already  been  taken  care  of.  The  resources  are identified  including  manpower  material  and  equipment.  The  performers  should have  adequate  delegation  and  financial  and  administrative  powers  and  have  the mandate for accomplishing the task.

The success of the trigger mechanism depends on the vision and perception of the planners. They are required to anticipate the likely activities with reference to the nature of the disaster and its impact. In fact the trigger mechanism can also be  called  the  operating  standard  procedure  where  the  implementations  of  the efforts  on  ground  are  well  laid  down.  Generally,  the  activities  will  include

evacuation,  search  and  rescue,  temporary  shelter,  food,  drinking  water,  clothing, health  and  sanitation,  communications,  accessibility,  and  public  information.  All these major activities which are common in all types of disasters will require subdivision and preparation of sub-action plans by each specified authority. They will be  required  to  list  all  requirements  and  their  availability  within  the  prescribed response time.

To  sum  up  the trigger mechanism  is an emergency  quick response mechanism  like  ignition  switch  which  when  energized  spontaneously  sets  the vehicle of management into motion on the road of disaster mitigation process.

## SECTION -I

## Introduction

- 1.1 India has been  traditionally vulnerable  to natural disasters on account of its  unique  geo-climatic  conditions.    Floods,  droughts,  cyclones,  earthquakes  and landslides have been a recurrent phenomena.  About 60% of the landmass is prone to earthquakes of various intensities; over 40 million hectares is prone to floods; about 8% of the total area is prone to cyclones and 68% of the area is susceptible to drought.   In the decade 1990-2000, an average of about 4344 people lost their lives and about 30 million people were affected by disasters every year.  The loss in terms of private, community and public assets has been astronomical.
- 1.2 At  the  global  level,  there  has  been  considerable  concern  over  natural disasters.  Even as substantial scientific and material progress is made, the loss of lives and property due to disasters has not decreased.  In fact, the human toll and economic losses have mounted.  It was  in this background that the United Nations General Assembly, in 1989,   declared  the decade 1990-2000 as the International Decade  for Natural Disaster Reduction with the objective  to reduce  loss  of lives and property  and restrict socio-economic damage  through concerted international action, specially in developing countries.
- 1.3 The super cyclone in Orissa  in  October, 1999 and the  Bhuj earthquake in Gujarat  in    January,  2001  underscored  the  need  to  adopt  a  multi  dimensional endeavour  involving diverse scientific, engineering, financial and social processes; the need to adopt multi  disciplinary and multi sectoral  approach and incorporation  of risk reduction in the developmental plans and strategies.
- 1.4 Over the past couple of years, the Government of India have brought about a  paradigm  shift  in  the  approach  to  disaster  management.    The  new  approach

proceeds  from  the  conviction  that  development  cannot  be  sustainable  unless disaster mitigation is built into the development process.  Another corner stone of the  approach  is  that  mitigation  has  to  be  multi-disciplinary  spanning  across  all sectors  of  development.    The  new  policy  also  emanates  from  the  belief  that investments in mitigation are much more cost effective than expenditure on relief and rehabilitation.

- 1.5 Disaster management occupies an important place in this country's policy framework as it is the  poor  and  the  under-privileged  who  are  worst  affected  on account of calamities/disasters.
- 1.6 The  steps  being  taken  by  the  Government  emanate  from  the  approach outlined  above.    The  approach  has  been  translated  into  a  National  Disaster Framework  [a  roadmap]  covering  institutional  mechanisms,  disaster  prevention strategy, early warning system, disaster mitigation, preparedness and response and human  resource  development.    The  expected  inputs,  areas  of  intervention  and agencies  to  be  involved  at  the  National,  State  and  district  levels  have  been identified and listed in the roadmap.  This roadmap has been shared with all the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations. Ministries and Departments of Government of India, and the State Governments/UT Administrations have been advised to develop their respective roadmaps taking the national  roadmap  as  a  broad  guideline.    There  is,  therefore,  now  a  common strategy underpinning the action being taken by all the participating organisations/stakeholders.  A copy of the roadmap is at Annexure - I.
- 1.7 The changed approach is being put into effect through:
- (a) Institutional changes
- (b) Enunciation  of policy
- (c) Legal and techno-legal framework

- (d) Mainstreaming Mitigation into Development process
- (e) Funding mechanism
- (f) Specific schemes addressing mitigation
- (g) Preparedness measures
- (h) Capacity building
- (i) Human Resource Development

and,  above  all,  community  participation.  These  are  detailed  in  the  following chapters.

## SECTION-II

## Institutional and Policy Framework

- 2.1 The  institutional  and  policy  mechanisms  for  carrying  out  response,  relief and rehabilitation have been well-established since Independence. These mechanisms have proved to be robust and effective insofar as response, relief and rehabilitation are concerned.    The changed policy/approach, however, mandates a priority to pre-disaster aspects of mitigation, prevention and preparedness and new institutional mechanisms are being put in place to address the policy change.
- 2.3 Mitigation,  preparedness  and  response  are  multi-disciplinary  functions, involving  a  number  of  Ministries/Departments.    Institutional  mechanisms  which would  facilitate  this  inter-disciplinary  approach  are  being  put  in  place.  It  is proposed  to  create  Disaster  Management  Authorities,  both  at  the  National  and State  levels,  with  representatives  from  the  relevant  Ministries/Departments  to bring about this coordinated and multi-disciplinary with experts covering a large number of branches.  The National Emergency Management Authority is proposed to be  constituted.    The  organization  will  be  multi-disciplinary  with  experts covering  a  large  number  of  branches.    The  National  Emergency  Management Authority is proposed as a combined Secretariat/Directorate structure - a structure which will be an integral part of the Government while, at the same time, retaining the flexibility of a filed organization. The Authority will be headed by an officer of the rank of Secretary/ Special Secretary to the Government in the Ministry of Home  Affairs  with  representatives  from  the  Ministries/Departments  of  Health, Water Resources, Environment &amp; Forest, Agriculture, Railways, Atomic Energy, Defence, Chemicals, Science &amp; Technology, Telecommunication, Urban Employment and Poverty alleviation, Rural Development and Indian Meteorological Department as Members.  The authority would meet as often as

required  and  review  the  Status  of  warning  systems,  mitigation  measure  and disaster  preparedness.  When  a  disaster  strikes,  the  Authority  will  coordinate disaster management activities.   The Authority will be responsible for:-

- · Providing necessary support and assistance to State Governments by way of resource  data,  macro-management  of  emergency  response,  specialized emergency response teams, sharing of disaster related data base etc.
- · Coordinating/mandating Government's policies for disaster reduction/mitigation
- · Ensuring adequate preparedness at all levels
- · Coordinating response to a disaster when it strikes
- · Assisting the Provincial Government in coordinating post disaster relief and rehabilitation
- · Coordinating  resources  of  all  National  Government  Department/agencies involved.
- · Monitor and introduce a culture of building requisite  features of disaster mitigation in all development plans and programmes.
- · Any other issues of work, which may be entrusted to it by the Government.

The States have also been asked to set up Disaster Management Authorities under the  Chief  Minister  with  Ministers  of  relevant  Departments  [Water  Resources, Agriculture, Drinking Water Supply, Environment &amp; Forests, Urban Development, Home, Rural Development etc.] as members.    10 States and UTs Tamil Nadu, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Orissa, Gujarat, Kerala, Nagaland, Delhi,  A&amp;N  administration  and  Chandigarh  Administration  have  notified  the authority. The other States are in the process of setting up similar authorities.

2.4 Re-structuring of the Relief Department in the States: At the State level, the work of post calamity relief  was being handled by the Departments of Relief &amp;  Rehabilitation. The Government of India is working with the State Governments  to  restructure  the  Departments  of  Relief  &amp;  Rehabilitation  into Departments of Disaster Management with an enhanced area of responsibility to include  mitigation  and  preparedness  apart  from  their  present  responsibilities  of relief and rehabilitation.  The changeover has already happened in 11 States/UTs Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan Tamil Nadu,  Uttaranchal,  Nagaland,  Andaman  &amp;  Nicobar  Administration,  Sikkim  and Lakshadweep. The change is under process in other States.

The States have been advised to restructure/re-group the officers/staff  within the Department of  Disaster Management  with definite functions to pursue the holistic approach to disaster management.  The four functional groups to be assigned with specific tasks within the departments are as indicted  below:-

-  Functional Group 1: Hazard Mitigation
-  Functional Group 2: Preparedness and Capacity Building
-  Functional Group 3: Relief and Response
-  Functional Group 4: Administration and Finance

2.5. At  the  district  level,  the  District  Magistrate  who  is  the  chief  coordinator will  be  the  focal  point  for  coordinating  all  activities  relating  to  prevention, mitigation and preparedness apart from his existing responsibilities pertaining to response and relief.  The District Coordination and Relief Committee is being reconstituted/re-designated  into  Disaster  Management  Committees  with  officers from  relevant  departments  being  added  as  members.    Because  of  its  enhanced mandate  of  mitigation  and  prevention,  the  district  heads  of  the  departments engaged  in  development  are  now  being  included  in  the  Committee  so  that mitigation  and  prevention  is  mainstreamed  into  the  district  plan.    The  existing

system of drawing up preparedness and response plans will continue.  There will, however,  also  be  a  long  term  mitigation  plan.    District  Disaster  Management Committees have already been constituted in 256 districts and are in the process of being constituted in the remaining districts.

- 2.6 Similarly,  sub-divisional  and  Block/Taluka  level  Disaster  Management Committees are also being constituted.  At the village level Disaster Management Committees and Disaster Management Teams are being constituted.  Each village in multi-hazard prone district will have a Disaster Management Plan.  The process of drafting the plans at all levels has already begun.  The Disaster Management Committee  which  draws  up  the  plans  consists  of  elected  representatives  at  the village level, local authorities; Government functionaries including doctors/paramedics of primary health centres located in the village, primary school teachers  etc.    The  plan  encompasses  prevention,  mitigation  and  preparedness measures.    The  Disaster  Management  Teams  at  the  village  level  will  consist  of members  of  youth  organisations  like  Nehru  Yuvak  Kendra  and  other  nongovernmental  organisations  as  well  as  able  bodied  volunteers  from  the  village. The  teams  are  provided  basic  training  in  evacuation,  evacuation,  search  and rescue, first aid trauma counseling etc.  The Disaster Management Committee will review  the  disaster  management  plan  at  least  once  in  a  year.    It  would  also generate  awareness  among  the  people  in  the  village  about  dos'  and  don'ts  for specific hazards depending on the vulnerability of the village.  A large number of village level Disaster Management Committees and Disaster Management Teams have already been constituted.
- 2.7 Disaster Management Policy: Disaster management is a multidisciplinary  activity  involving  a  number  of  a  number  of  Departments/agencies spanning across all sectors of development. Where a number of Departments/agencies are involved, it is essential to have a policy in place, as it

serves  as  a  framework  for  action  by  all  the  relevant  departments/agencies.    A National policy on disaster management has been drafted, and is in the process of consultations. In the line with the changed focus, the policy proposes to integrate disaster mitigation into development planning. The policy shall inform all spheres of Central Government activity and shall enjoin upon all existing sectoral policies. The  broad  objective  of  the  policy  are  to  minimize  the  loss  of  lives  and  social, private  and  community  assets  because  of  natural  or  man-made  disasters  and contribute to sustainable development and better standards of living for all, more specifically for the poor and vulnerable section by ensuring that the developments gains are not lost through natural calamities/ disaster.

- 2.8 The  policy  notes  that  State  Governments  are  primarily  responsible  for disaster management including prevention and mitigation, while the Government of India provides assistance where necessary as per the norms laid down from time to time and proposes that this overall framework may continue.  However, since response  to  a  disaster  requires  coordination  of  resources  available  across  all  the Departments of the Government, the policy mandates that the Central Government will,  in  conjunction  with  the  State  Governments,  seek  to  ensure  that  such  a coordination mechanism is laid down through an appropriate chain of command so that mobilization of resources is facilitated.
- 2.9 The broad features of the draft national policy on disaster management are enunciated below:-
- i) A holistic and pro-active approach towards prevention, mitigation and preparedness will be adopted for disaster management.
- ii) Each  Ministry/Department  of  the  Central/State  Government  will  set apart  an  appropriate  quantum  of  funds  under  the  Plan  for  specific schemes/projects addressing vulnerability reduction and preparedness.

- iii) Where there is a shelf of projects, projects addressing mitigation will be given  priority.  Mitigation  measures  shall  be  built  into  the  on-going schemes/programmes
- iv) Each project in a hazard prone area will have mitigation as an essential term of reference. The project report will include a statement as to how the project addresses vulnerability reduction.
- v) Community involvement and awareness generation, particularly that of the vulnerable segments of population and women has been emphasized as  necessary  for  sustainable  disaster  risk  reduction.  This  is  a  critical component of the policy since communities are the first responders to disasters and, therefore, unless they are empowered and made capable of  managing  disasters,  any  amount  of  external  support  cannot  lead  to optimal results.
- vi) There will be close interaction with the corporate sector, nongovernmental  organisations  and  the  media  in  the  national  efforts  for disaster prevention/vulnerability reduction.
- vii) Institutional  structures/appropriate  chain  of  command  will  be  built  up and appropriate training imparted to disaster managers at various levels to ensure coordinated and quick response at all levels; and development of inter-State arrangements for sharing of resources during emergencies.
- viii) A culture of planning and preparedness is to be inculcated at all levels for capacity building measures.
- ix) Standard operating procedures and disaster management plans at state and district levels as well as by relevant central government departments for handling specific disasters will be laid down.
- x) Construction designs must correspond to the requirements as laid down in relevant Indian Standards.
- xi) All lifeline buildings in seismic zones III, IV &amp; V - hospitals, railway stations, airports/airport control towers, fire station buildings, bus stands

major administrative centres will need to be evaluated and, if necessary, retro-fitted.

- xii) The existing relief codes in the States will be revised to develop them into disaster management  codes/manuals for institutionalizing the planning process with particular attention to mitigation and preparedness.
- xiii) To promote international  cooperation  in  the  area  of  disaster  response, preparedness,  and  mitigation  in  tune  with  national  strategic  goals  and objectives.
- 2.10 The States have also been advised to formulate State DM Policies with the broad objective to minimize the loss of lives and social, private and community assets  and  contribute  to  sustainable  development.    The  States  of  Gujarat  and Madhya  Pradesh  have  States  Policies  for  Disaster  Management  in  place  while other States are in process.

## Legal and Techno-legal Framework

- 2.11 Disaster Management Act: The States have been advised to enact Disaster Management  Acts.    These  Acts  provide  for  adequate  powers  for  authorities coordinating mitigation, preparedness and response as well as for mitigation/prevention measures required to be undertaken.  Two States Gujarat &amp; Bihar, have already enacted such a law.  Other States are in the process.
- 2.12 Disaster Management Code: In line with the changed approach, the State Governments have also been advised to convert their  Relief Codes into Disaster Management  Codes  by  building  into  it  the  process  necessary  for  drawing  up disaster  management  and  mitigation  plans  as  well  as  elements  of  preparedness apart  from  response  and  relief.    A  Committee  constituted  under  the  Executive Director, National institute of Disaster Management has drafted a Model Disaster

Management Code which is being circulated to the States so as to assist them in this process.  Some States have constituted committees to revise the codes as per GOI guidelines.    The  revised  codes  will  ensure  that  the  process  of  drawing  up disaster management  plans and mitigation and preparedness measures get institutionalized.

## SECTION III

## Disaster Prevention and Mitigation

- 3.1 The  Yokohama  message  emanating  from  the  international  decade  for natural disaster reduction in  May, 1994 underlined the need for an emphatic shift in  the  strategy  for  disaster  mitigation.    It  was  inter  alia  stressed  that  disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness and relief are  four elements which contribute to  and  gain,    from  the  implementation    of  the  sustainable  development  policies. These elements alongwith environmental protection and sustainable development, are closely inter related, and it was therefore, recommended that Nations should incorporate    them  in  their  development  plans  and  ensure  efficient    follow  up measures  at  the  community,  sub-regional,  regional,  national  and  international levels.    The  Yokohama  Strategy  also  emphasized    that  disaster    prevention, mitigation  and  preparedness    are  better  than  disaster  response  in  achieving    the goals  and  objectives  of  vulnerability    reduction.    Disaster  response  alone  is  not sufficient as it yields only temporary results at a very high cost.  Prevention and mitigation  contribute  to  lasting  improvement  in  safety  and  are  essential  to integrated disaster management.
- 3.2 Mainstreaming Disaster Management into Development: The Government  of  India have adopted mitigation and prevention as essential components of their development strategy.  The Tenth Five Year Plan document has  a  detailed  chapter  on  Disaster  Management.    A  copy  of  the  said  chapter  is enclosed at Annexure - II. The plan emphasizes the fact that development cannot be sustainable without mitigation being built into developmental  process.  Each State is supposed to prepare a plan scheme for disaster mitigation in accordance with the approach outlined in the plan.  In brief, mitigation is being mainstreamed into developmental planning.

- 3.3 Financial Arrangement: As  indicated  in  the  earlier  chapter,  the  Finance Commission makes recommendations with regard to devolution of funds between the  Central  Government  and  State  Governments  as  also  outlays  for  relief  and rehabilitation.  The earlier Finance Commissions were mandated to look at relief and rehabilitation.  The Terms of Reference of the Twelfth Finance Commission have been changed and the Finance Commission has been mandated to look at the requirements  for  mitigation  and  prevention  apart  from  its  existing  mandate  of looking  at  relief  and  rehabilitation.    A  Memorandum  has  been  submitted  to  the Twelfth Finance Commission after consultation with States.  The Memorandum proposes the creating of a disaster mitigation fund, which will assist the States in taking mitigation measures like retrofitting of lifeline buildings, coastal shelterbelt plantation etc.
- 3.4 The Government of India have issued guidelines that where there is a shelf of projects, projects addressing mitigation will be given a priority.  It has also been mandated that each project in a hazard prone area will have disaster prevention/mitigation  as  a  term  of  reference  and  the  project  document  has  to reflect  as  to  how  the  project  addresses  that  term  of  reference.    A  copy  of  the guidelines is at Annexure - III.
- 3.5 Flood  Preparedness  and  response: In  order  to  respond  effectively  to floods, Ministry of Home Affairs have initiated National Disaster Risk Management  Programme  in  all  the  flood-prone  States.    Assistance  is  being provided to the States to draw up disaster management plans at the State, District, Block/Taluka  and  Village  levels.    Awareness  generation  campaigns  to  sensitize the  all the  stakeholders  on  the  need  for  flood  preparedness  and  mitigation measures.  Elected representatives and officials are being trained in flood disaster management under the programme. Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal, Assam and Uttar Pradesh  are  among  the  17  multi-hazard  prone  States  where  this  programme  is

being implemented with assistance from UNDP, USAID and European Commission.

- 3.5 Earthquake  Risk  Mitigation: A  comprehensive  programme  has  been taken  up  for  earthquake  risk  mitigation.    Although,  the  BIS  has  laid  down  the standards  for  construction  in  the  seismic  zones,  these  were  not  being  followed. The building construction in urban and suburban areas is regulated by the Town and Country Planning Acts and Building Regulations.  In many cases, the Building regulations  do  not  incorporate  the  BIS  codes.    Even  where  they  do,  the  lack  of knowledge  regarding  seismically  safe  construction  among  the  architects  and engineers  as  well  as  lack  of  awareness  regarding  their  vulnerability  among  the population  led  to  most  of  the  construction  in  the  urban/sub-urban  areas  being without reference to BIS standards.  In the rural areas, the bulk of the housing is non-engineered construction.  The mode of construction in the rural areas has also changed  from  mud  and  thatch  to  brick  and  concrete construction thereby increasing the vulnerability.  The increasing population has led to settlements in vulnerable areas close to the river bed areas which are prone to liquefaction.  The Government have moved to address these issues.
- 3.6 National Core Group for Earthquake Risk Mitigation: A National Core Group for Earthquake  Risk Mitigation has been constituted  consisting of experts in  earthquake  engineering  and  administrators.    The    Core  Group    has  been assigned  with the responsibility  of drawing up  a strategy and plan of action for mitigating the impact  of earthquakes; providing advice and guidance  to the States on  various aspects of earthquake  mitigation; developing/organizing    the preparation  of    handbooks/pamphlets/type  designs  for    earthquake    resistant construction;  working  out  systems  for  assisting  the  States  in  the  seismically vulnerable    zones  to  adopt/integrate    appropriate    Bureau  of  Indian  Standards codes  in  their  building  byelaws;  evolving  systems  for  training    of  municipal

engineers as also practicing  architects and engineers in the private sector in the salient features  of Bureau of Indian  Standards codes  and the amended byelaws; evolving  a  system    of  certification  of  architects/engineers    for  testing  their knowledge  of earthquake  resistant construction; evolving systems for training of masons  and carry out intensive  awareness  generation  campaigns.

3.7 Review of building bye-laws and their adoption: Most casualties during earthquakes  are  caused  by  the  collapse  of  structures.    Therefore  structural mitigation measures are the key to make a significant impact towards earthquake safety in our country.  In view of this the States in earthquake prone zones have been  requested  to  review,  and  if  necessary,  amend  their  building  bye-laws  to incorporate the BIS seismic codes for construction in the concerned zones. Many States  have  initiated  necessary  action  in  this  regard.  An  Expert  Committee appointed  by  the Core  Group  on  Earthquake  Risk  Mitigation  has  already submitted  its  report  covering  appropriate  amendments  to  the  existing  Town  &amp; Country  Planning  Acts,  Land  Use  Zoning  Regulation,  Development  Control Regulations &amp; Building Bylaws, which could be used by the State Governments &amp; the local bodies there-under to upgrade the existing legal instruments. The Model Building Bylaws also cover the aspect of ensuring technical implementation of the safety  aspects  in  all  new  constructions  &amp;  upgrading  the  strength  of  existing structurally vulnerable constructions. To facilitate the review of   existing building byelaws and adoption of the proposed amendments by the State Governments &amp; UT  administrations,  discussion  workshops  at  regional  level  in  the  country  are being organized.  It is expected that all planning authorities and local bodies will soon  have  development  control  regulations  and  building  byelaws  which  would include multi-hazard safety provisions.

- 3.8 Development  and  Revision  of  Codes : There  are Bureau  of  Indian Standard  (BIS)  codes  which  are  relevant  for  multi-hazard  resistant  design  and construction.  Some  of  the    codes  need  to  be  updated.  There  are  some  areas  for which  codes  do  not  exist.  An  action  plan  has  been  drawn  up  for  revision  of existing  codes,  development  of  new  codes  and  documents/commentaries,  and making these codes and documents available all over the country including on-line access  to  these  codes.  An  Apex  committee  consisting  of  representatives  of Ministry of Consumer Affairs, BIS and MHA   has been constituted to review the mechanism  and  process  of  development  of  codes  relevant  to  earthquake  risk mitigation and establish a protocol for revision by BIS.
- 3.9 Hazard Safety Cells in States: The States have been advised to constitute Hazard  Safety  Cells  (HSC)  headed  by  the  Chief  Engineer,  State  PWD  with necessary engineering staff so as to establish mechanism for proper implementation  of  the  building  codes  in  all  future  Govt.  constructions,  and  to ensures  the  safety  of  buildings  and  structures  from  various  hazards.    The  HSCs will    also  be  responsible  for  carrying  out  appropriate  design  review  of  all Government buildings to be constructed in the State, act as an advisory cell to the State Government on the different aspects of building safety against hazards and act as a consultant to the State Government for retrofitting of the lifeline buildings. Rajasthan,  West  Bengal,  Delhi  and  Chhatisgarh  have  already  constituted  these cells and other States are in the process.
- 3.10 National Programme for Capacity Building of Engineers and Architects  in  Earthquake  Risk  Mitigation: Two  National  Programmes  for Capacity  Building  in  Earthquake  Risk  Mitigation  for  Engineers  and  Architects respectively, have been approved to assist the State Govts in building up capacities for  earthquake  mitigation.  Under  these  two  programmes  10,000  engineers  and 10,000 architects in the States will be given training in seismically safe building

designs and related techno-legal requirements. Assistance is being provided to the State/UTs to build the capacities of more than 125 State Engineering Colleges and 110  Architecture  Colleges  to  be  able  to  provide  advisory  services  to  the  State Govts to put in place appropriate techno-legal regime, assessment of building and infrastructures  and  their  retrofitting.    These  institutions  will  function  as  State Resource Institutions. Twenty-one Engineering and Architecture Institutions have been designated  as  National  Resource  Institutes  to  train  the  faculty  members  of selected  State  Engineering  and  Architecture  colleges.  450  engineering  faculty members and 250 architecture faculty members of these State Resource Institutions will be trained during the current year.

3.11 Training  of  rural  masons: A  programme  to  assist  the  States/UTs  in training and certification of 50000 masons has been formulated in conultation with Housing  and  Urban  Development  Corporation  (HUDCO)  and  the  Ministry  of Rural  Development.  The  training  module  for  masons  to  include  multi-hazard resistant construction has also been prepared by an expert committee, and revised curriculum will be introduced in the vocational training programme of Ministry of Human Resource Development.

## 3.12 Earthquake  Engineering  in  Undergraduate  Engineering/Architecture

Curricula : The role of engineers and architects is crucial in reducing earthquake risks by ensuring that the construction adhere to the norms of seismic safety. In view of this, the elements of earthquake engineering is being integrated into the undergraduate engineering and architecture courses.  Model course curricula have been developed for adoption by various technical institutions and universities. and circulated  to  the  Universities  and  Technical  Institutions  for  integration  into  the under graduate curriculum.  Ministry of Home Affairs  is working with All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) and Council of Architecture (COA)  for

introduction  of  revised  curricula  for  engineering  and  architecture  course  from 2005-2006.

3. 13 Retrofitting of Lifeline buildings: While  these mitigation measures will take care  of the new  constructions, the problem  of  unsafe  existing  building stock  would still  remain.  It will not be possible to address the entire existing building stock, therefore the life line buildings like hospitals, schools or buildings where  people  congregate  like  cinema  halls,  multi-storied  apartments  are  being focussed on.  The States have been advised to have these buildings assessed and where necessary retrofitted. The Ministries of Civil Aviation, Railways, Telecommunication, Power and Health and Family Welfare have been advised to take necessary action for detailed evaluation and retrofitting of lifeline buildings located in seismically vulnerable zones so as  to ensure that they comply with BIS norms,  Action  plan  have  been  drawn  up  by  these  Ministries  for detailed vulnerability  analysis  and  retrofitting/  strengthening  of  buildings  and  structures. The Ministry of Finance have been requested to advise the financial institutions to give loans for retrofitting on easy terms. Accordingly the Ministry of Finance had advised Reserve Bank of India to issue suitable instructions to all the Banks and Financial  Institutions  to  see  that  BIS  codes/bye  laws  are  scrupulously  followed while financing/refinancing construction activities in seismically vulnerable zones.

3.14 National Earthquake Risk Mitigation Project: An Earthquake Mitigation Project has been drawn up, with an estimated cost of Rs.1132 crore.  The project has been  given  in-principle clearance by the Planning  Commission.    The programme includes    detailed    evaluation  and  retrofitting    of    lifeline  buildings such  as    hospitals,  schools,  water  and  power  supply    units,  telecommunication buildings, airports/airport control towers, railway stations, bus stands and important  administrative buildings in the States/UTs in seismic zones  IV and  V.

The  programme  also  includes    training of masons  in  earthquake  resistant constructions, as well as, assistance to the State Governments to put in place  an appropriate  techno legal regime.

## 3.15 Accelerated Urban Earthquake Vulnerability Reduction Programme:

An accelerated   urban  earthquake vulnerability reduction programme has been taken up in  38 cities in seismic  zones III, IV &amp; V with population  of  half a million and above. These  cities are Dehradun,  Delhi, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Surat, Greater Mumbai,  Bhiwandi, Nasik, Pune, Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Chennai, Patna, Asansol, Guwahati, Vadodara, Koimbatore, Ahmedabad, Agara,  Varanasi, Bareily, Meerut, Lucknow, Kanpur, Kolkatta, Srinagar, Jammu, Indore,  Jabalpur,  Amritsar,  Jalandhar,  Vijayawada,  Dhanbad,  Mangalore,  Kochi, Kozhikod and Trivandrum. 474 Orientation programmes have been organized for senior officers and representatives of the local planning and development bodies to sensitize  them  on  earthquake  preparedness  and  mitigation  measures.  Training programmes have been organized for engineers and architects to impart knowledge  about  seismically  safe  construction  and  implementation    of  BIS norms.  So far 1088 engineers and 825 architects have been trained. For enhanced school safety, education programmes have been organized in schools, colleges and other educational institutions. About 370 educational institutions have been visited by the earthquake disaster management specialist in these cities. This programme will be further extended to 166 earthquake prone districts in seismic zones IV &amp;

- V. Awareness generation programmes, community and neighbourhood organizations have been started in these cities. These cities are also being assisted to  review  and  amend  their  building  bye-laws  to  incorporate  multi  hazard  safety provisions.  City  Disaster  Management  Plans  are  being  developed  under  the project.  Nine Cities have prepared city Disaster Management Plans so far.

3.16 Mainstreaming  Mitigation  in Rural  Development  Schemes: Rural housing    and    community  assets    for  vulnerable    sections  of  the  population  are created on a fairly large scale  by the Ministry  of Rural Development under the Indira  Awas Yojna(IAY) and Sampooran Grameen  Rojgar Yojna(SGRY).  About 250  thousand    small    but  compact  housing  units  are  constructed  every  year, besides community  assets  such  as community  centres,  recreation centres, anganwadi centres etc.  Technology support  is provided  by about  two hundred rural    housing    centres  spread  over  the  entire    country.    The  Ministry  of  Home Affairs  is  working  with  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  for  changing  the guidelines so that the houses constructed under IAY or school buildings/community buildings constructed under SGRY are earthquake/cyclone/flood resistant; as also that the schemes addressing mitigation are given priority under SGRY.  Ministry of Rural Development are carrying out an  exercise  for  this  purpose.  This  initiative  is  expected  to  go  a  long  way  in popularization of  seismically  safe construction  at village/block level

3.17 Core Group on Cyclone Mitigation: A National Core Group on Cyclone Monitoring &amp; Mitigation has been constituted. Experts from Indian Meteorological Department, National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting,  Central  Water  Commission,  National  Remote  Sensing  Agency  and Indian  Space  Research  Organisation  have  been  made  the  Members  of  the  Core Group, besides administrators from the relevant Ministries/Departments and State Governments vulnerable to cyclones. The Group has been assigned the responsibility of looking at warning protocols for cyclones; coordination mechanism between different Central and State Ministries/Departments/Organisations; mechanism for dissemination of warning to the  local  people  and;  cyclone  mitigation  measures  required  to  be  taken  for  the coastal States. The Group will also suggest short-term and long-term measures on technology  up-gradation.  The  cyclone  warning  formats  have  been  revised  to

ensure that the warning is more meaningful to the community at risk.  A project has been taken up with the United States for upgradation of models for cyclone track prediction .

3.18 National  Cyclone  Mitigation  Project: A  project  for  Cyclone  Mitigation (estimated cost Rs.1050 crore) has been drawn up in consultation with the cyclone prone  States.    This  project  envisages  construction  of  cyclone  shelters,  coastal shelter belt plantation in areas which are prone to storm surges, strengthening of warning systems, training and education etc.  This project has also been given inprinciple  clearance    by  the  Planning  Commission  and  is  being  taken  up  with World Bank assistance.

3.19 Landslide Hazard Mitigation: A National Core Group has been constituted  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Secretary,    Border  Management  and comprising of Secretary, Department of Science and Technology, Secretary, Road Transport &amp; Highways, and the Heads of Geological Survey of India and National Remote  Sensing  Agency  for  drawing  up  a  strategy  and  plan  of  action  for mitigating  the  impact  of  landslides,  provide  advise  and  guidance  to    the  State Governments  on  various  aspects  of  landslide  mitigation,  monitor    the  activities relating to landslide mitigation including landslide hazard zonation and to evolve early warning systems and protocols for landslides/landslide risk reduction.  The Government  have  designated  Geological  Survey  of  India  (GSI)  as  the  nodal agency  responsible  for  coordinating/undertaking    geological  studies,  landslides hazard zoantion, monitoring landslides/avalanches, studying the factors responsible and suggesting precautionary and preventing measures. The States/UTs have been requested to share the list of habitations close to landslide prone areas in order to supplement GSI's on going assessment of such areas based on the Survey of India's Toposheet and their existing data dbase on landslide for the purpose of landslide hazard zonation being carried out by them.  A national

strategy  for  mitigating  landslide  hazard  in  the  county  is  being  drawn  up  in consultation with all the agencies concerned.

- 3.19 Disaster  Risk  Management  Programme :  A  Disaster  Risk  Management Programme has been taken up in 169 districts in 17 multi-hazard prone States with the assistance from UNDP, USAID and European Union. These States are Assam, Arunachal  Pradehs,  Bihar,  Delhi,  Gujarat,  Maharashtra,  Meghalaya,  Mizoram, Manipur, Nalaland, Orissa, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal and West Bengal, Under this project, the States are being assisted to draw up State, district and Block level disaster management plans;  village disaster management  plans  are  being  developed  in  conjunction  with  the  Panchayati  Raj Institutions  and    disaster  management  teams  consisting  of  village  volunteers  are being trained in preparedness and response functions such as search and rescue, first  aid,  relief  coordination,  shelter  management  etc.      States  and  District  level multi-hazard resistant Emergency Operation Centres (EOCs) are also being set up under  the  programme.    Equipment  needs  for  district  and  State  Emergency Operation Centres have been identified by the State nodal agencies and equipment is being provided to equip these  EOCs.  Orientation training of masons, engineers and  architects  in  disaster  resistant  technologies  have  been  initiated  in  these districts and construction of model demonstration buildings will be started soon.
- 3.20 Under this programme Disaster Management Plans have been prepared for 8643  villages,  1046  Gram  Panchayat,  188  blocks  and  82  districts.  More  than 29000  elected  representatives  of  Panchayati  Raj  Institutions  have  already  been trained, besides imparting training to members of voluntary organizations. About 18000  Government  functionaries  have  been  trained  in  disaster  mitigation  and preparedness  at  different  levels.  865  engineers  and  425  architects  have  been trained  under  this  programme  in  vulnerability  assessment  and  retrofitting  of lifeline buildings. 600 master trainers and 1200 teachers have already been trained

in different districts in disaster preparedness and mitigation. Disaster Management Committees  consisting  of  elected  representatives,  civil  society  members,  Civil Defence  volunteers  and  Government  functionaries  have  been  constituted  at  all levels including  village/urban local body/ward  levels.  Disaster  Management Teams have been constituted in villages and are being imparted training in basic functions  of  first  aid,  rescue,  evacuation  and  related  issues.  The  thrust  of  the programme is to build up capabilities of the community since the community is invariably the first responder. Capacity building of the community has been very helpful even in normal situations when isolated instances of drowning, burns etc. take place. With the creation of awareness generation on disaster mitigation, the community will be able to function as a well-knit unit in case of any emergency. Mock  drills  are  carried  out  from  time  to  time  under  the  close  supervision  of Disaster  Management  Committees.  The  Disaster  Management  Committees  and Disaster Management Teams have been established by notifications issued by the State Governments which will ensure that the entire system is institutionalized and does not disintegrate after the conclusion of the programme. The key points being stressed  under  this  programme  are  the  need  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the programme,  development  of  training  modules;  manuals  and  codes,  focused attention to awareness  generation  campaigns;  institutionalization of disaster management  committees  and  disaster  management  teams,  disaster  management plans and mock-drills and establishment of techno-legal regimes.

3.21 Human  Resource  Development: Human  Resource  Development  at  all levels is critical to institutionalization of disaster mitigation strategy. The National Centre  for  Disaster  Management  at  the  national  level  has  been  upgraded  and designated as the National Institute of Disaster Management. It is being developed as  a  Regional  Centre  of  Excellence  in  Asia.  The  National  Institute  of  Disaster Management will develop training modules at different levels, undertake training of  trainers  and  organize  training  programmes  for  planners,  administrators  and

command  functionaries.  Besides,  the  other  functions  assigned  to  the  National Institute  of  Disaster  Management  include  development  of  exhaustive  National level information base on disaster management policies, prevention mechanisms, mitigation measures; and providing consultancy to various States in strengthening their disaster management systems and capacities as well as preparation of disaster management plans and strategies  for  hazard  mitigation  and  disaster  response.  It has been decided to incorporate elements of disaster management in the training curricula of Civil Services. For the three All India Services (IAS, IPS and Indian Forest Service), training curricula have already been drawn up and integrated into the training curricula of these All India Services with effect from 2004-2005.  For other  Civil  Services  at  the  national  and  state  levels,  training  modules  are  being developed to be included from the next year.

- 3.22 NDM cells in Administrative Training Institutes: Disaster Management faculties have already been created in 29 State level training institutes located in 28 States. These faculties are being directly supported by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The State Training Institutions take up several focused training programmes for different target groups within the State. The Disaster Management faculties in these Institutes are being further strengthened so as to enable them to develop as Institutes of Excellence for a specific disaster. Assistance to the State level  training  institutes  will  be  provided  by  the  National  Institute  of  Disaster Management  in  the development  of training/capsules training modules  for different functionaries at different levels.
- 3.23 Awareness generation: Recognizing that  awareness  about  vulnerabilities is  a  sine  qua  non  for  inducing  a  mindset  of  disaster  prevention,  mitigation  and preparedness,  the  Government  has  initiated  a  nation-wide  awareness  generation campaign  as  part  of  its  overall  disaster  risk  management  strategy.  In  order  to devise  an  effective  and  holistic  campaign,  a  steering  committee  for  mass  media

campaign  has  been  constituted  at  the  national  level  with  due  representation  of experts from diverse streams of communication. The Committee has formulated a campaign strategy aimed at changing peoples' perception of natural hazards and has consulted the agencies and experts associated with advertising and media to instill a culture of safety against natural hazards.

- 3.24 Apart from the use of print and electronic media, it is proposed to utilize places with high public visibility viz. hospitals, schools, railway stations and bus terminals,  airports  and  post  offices,  commercial  complexes  and  municipality offices etc. to make people aware of their vulnerabilities and promote creation of a safe living environment.
- 3.25 A novel method being tried is the use of government stationery viz. postal letters, bank stationery, railway tickets, airline boarding cards and tickets etc. for disseminating  the  message  of  disaster  risk  reduction.  Slogans  and  messages  for this purpose  have  already  been  developed  and  have  been  communicated  to concerned  Ministries/agencies  for  printing  and  dissemination.  The  mass  media campaign  will  help  build  the  knowledge,  attitude  and  skills  of  the  people  in vulnerability reduction and sustainable disaster risk management measures.
- 3.26 Disaster Awareness in School Curriculum: Disaster  management  as  a subject in Social Sciences has been introduced in the school curriculum for Class VIII  &amp;  IX.  The  Central  Board  of  Secondary  Education  (CBSE)  which  has introduced  the  curriculum  runs  a  very  large  number  of  schools  throughout  the country and the course curriculum is invariably followed by the State Boards of Secondary  Education.  Teachers  are  being  trained  to  teach  disaster  management Syllabus  for  Class  X  is  being  finalized  and  will  be  introduced  in  the  course curriculum soon. The State Governments have been advised to take similar steps vis-à-vis their school boards.  Several States Governments have already introduced

the same curriculum in Class VIII. Ministry is  working with the Council of Board of  School  Education  (COBSE)  to  facilitate  inclusion  of  disaster  management  in public education in all 39 School Boards in the country.

3.27 Information, Education and Communication: In order to assist the State Governments in capacity building and awareness generation activities and to learn from past experiences including sharing of best practices, the Ministry of Home Affairs  has  compiled/prepared  a  set  of  resource  materials  developed  by  various organisations/institutions to be replicated and disseminated by State Governments based  on  their  vulnerabilities  after  translating  it  into  the  local  languages.  The voluminous material which runs into about 10000 pages has been divided into 4 broad sections in 7 volumes. These sections cover planning to cope with disasters; education  and  training;  construction  toolkit;  and  information,  education  and communication toolkit including multi-media resources on disaster mitigation and preparedness. The Planning section contains material for analyzing a community's risk,  development  of  Preparedness.  Mitigation  and  disaster  management  plans, coordinating  available  resources  and  implementing  measures  for  risk  reduction. Model  bye-laws,  DM  Policy,  Act  and  model  health  sector  plan  have  also  been included.  Education  and  Training  includes  material  for  capacity  building  and upgradation of skills of policy makers, administrators, trainers, engineers etc. in planning for and mitigating against natural disasters. Basic and detailed training modules  in  disaster  preparedness  have  been  incorporated  along  with  training methodologies for trainers, for community preparedness and manuals for training at  district,  block,  panchayat  and  village  levels.  For  creating  a  disaster-resistant building  environment,  the  Construction  Toolkit  addresses  the  issue  of  seismic resistant  construction  and  retrofitting  of  existing  buildings.  BIS  Codes,  manuals and guidelines for RCC, Masonry and other construction methodologies as also for repair and retrofitting of masonry and low-rise buildings have been included.

- 3.28 The  IEC  material  seeks  to  generate  awareness  to  induce  mitigation  and preparedness measures for risk reduction.  Material and strategies used by various States  and  international  organizations,  including  tips  on  different  hazards,  have been incorporated along with multi-media CDs on disasters. The material has been disseminated to all the State Governments/UT Administrations with the request to have the relevant material, based on the vulnerability of each district, culled out, translated into local languages and disseminate widely down to the village level.

## SECTION IV

## Preparedness

- 4.1 Mitigation  and  preparedness  measures  go  hand  in  hand  for  vulnerability reduction  and  rapid  professional  response  to  disasters.    The  Bhuj  earthquake  in January,  2001  brought  out  several  inadequacies    in  the  system.    Professionally trained search and rescue  teams  were not available; specialized dog squad to look for live bodies under the debris  were not available; and there was no centralized resource inventory for emergency response.   Although army played a pivotal role in search  and  rescue    and  also  set  up  their  hospital  after  the  collapse  of Government hospital at Bhuj,  the need  for fully equipped  mobile hospitals with trained personnel  was felt  acutely.  Despite these constraints, the response was fairly well organized.  However, had these constraints been  taken care  of before hand, the response  would have been even more professional and rapid which may have reduced  the loss of lives.  Specialist  search and  rescue  teams from other countries did reach  Bhuj.  However, precious time was lost and even with these specialist teams it was not possible to cover all severely affected areas as quickly as the Government would have desired.  It was, therefore, decided that we should remove these inadequacies and be in a stage of preparedness at all times.
- 4.2 Specialist  Response  Teams: The  Central  Government  are  now  in  the process of training and equipping eight battalions of CPMFs as specialist response teams.        Each  team  consists  of  45  personnel  including  doctors,  paramedics, structural engineers etc and thus there will be 144 Specialist Search and Rescue Teams in the earmarked eight battalions. The process of training and equipping of the  144  specialist  search  and  rescue  teams  etc  has  begun.  18  teams  have  been trained  so  far.  These  teams  are  being  trained  in  collapsed  structure  search  and rescue, medical first response, rescue and evacuation in flood and cyclone, under water rescue etc. In effect they will have the capability to operate in all types of

terrain  in  all  contingencies/disasters.  It  is  proposed  to  group  together  the  eight battalions of CPMFs earmarked for specialized emergency response as 'National Emergency Response Force'. These specialist response teams are being provided modern  equipments  and  also  dog  squads  for  search  and  rescue.  They  will  be provided  with  special  uniforms  made  of  fire  retardant  materials  with  enhanced visibility in low light and having equipment carrying capacity.

- 4.3 Apart from specialist  search  &amp;  rescue  units,  it  has  been  decided    that  all personnel  of  Central  Police  Organizations  should  also  be    imparted  training    in search and rescue so that they can be  requisitioned to the site  of incident without loss of time.  Pending arrival of the specialist teams, the battalions located near the site of incident  would be deployed immediately.  For this purpose, a curriculum has already  been drawn up and integrated into the training  curriculum of CPMFs.
- 4.4 Setting up of Search and Rescue Teams in  States: The States have been advised to set up their own Specialist Teams for responding to disasters.  Ministry of  Home  Affairs  will  provide  assistance  for  the  training  of  the  State    trainers. Many States/UTs have initiated action for setting up of specialized SAR units. Ten States have identified the Training Centers for training in Search and Rescue in the States. They have also identified trainers who will be imparted training at CPMF training institutions. Some states e.g. Maharashtra, Orissa, Gujarat and Delhi have trained  search  and  rescue  teams.  It  has  been  provided  that  10%  of  the  annual inflows  into  the  CRF  can  be  used  for  the  procurement  of  search  and  rescue equipment and communication equipment.  States have been advised to include training in search and rescue in the training of State Armed Police.

.

- 4.5 Regional Response Centres: Fourteen Regional Response Centres (RRCs) are  being  set  up    across  the  country  to  enable  immediate  response  to  floods, cyclones,  earthquakes,  landslides  etc.  Standard  cache  of  equipment  and  relief materials  will  be  kept  in  these  RRCs  and  Specialist  Response  Teams  will  be stationed  during  the  flood/cyclone  seasons  for  immediate  assistance  to  the  State Governments.  Caches  of  equipments  are  being  procured  and  all  RRCs  will  be operational soon.
- 4.6 A Steering Committee has been constituted in the Ministry to oversee the creation of capabilities for emergency response.
- 4.7 Health  Preparedness :  A  200  bedded  mobile  hospital,  fully  trained  and equipped is being set up and attached to a leading Government hospital in Delhi. Three additional mobile hospitals with all medical and emergency equipments are proposed to be located in different parts of the country.  These mobile hospitals will also be attached to the leading Government hospitals in the country.  This will enable the mobile hospitals to extend assistance to the hospitals with which they are  attached  in  normal  time.    They  will  be  airlifted  during  emergencies  with additional  doctors/paramedics  taken  from  the  hospitals  with  which  the  mobile hospitals are attached to the site of disaster.

## 4.8 Hospital Preparedness and Emergency Health Management in Medical

Education: Hospital preparedness is crucial to any disaster response system. Each hospital need to have an emergency preparedness plan to deal with mass casualty incidents and the hospital administration/ doctor trained for this emergency. The curriculum for medical doctors does not at present include Hospital Preparedness for    emergencies.  Therefore  capacity  building  through  in-service  training  of  the current  heath  managers  and  medical  personnel  in  Hospital  Preparedness  for emergencies or mass causality incident management is essential. At the same time

in  order  that,  the  future  health  managers  acquire  these  skills  it  is  proposed  to include  health  emergency  management  in  the  undergraduate  and  post  graduate medical  curricula.  In  consultation  with  Medical  Council  of  India(MCI),  two committees have been constituted for preparation of curriculum for introduction of emergency health management in MBBS curriculum, and preparation of in-service training  of  Hospital  Managers  and  Professionals.  Rajiv  Gandhi  University  of Health  Sciences  Karnataka  have  been  identified  as  the  lead  national  resource institution for the purpose.

- 4.9 Incident Command  System : In order to professionalize emergency response management, it is proposed to introduce the Incident Command System in the country.  This system provides for specialist incident command teams with an  Incident  Commander  and  officers  trained  in  different  aspects  of  incident management - logistics, operations, planning, safety, media management etc. The LBSNAA Mussoorrie has been designated as the nodal training institution. Three programmes for the training of trainers have so far been held at LBSNAA and 42 officers  have been trained in Basic and Intermediate ICS course and 29 officers trained in Planning Sections module.
- 4.10 Emergency  Support Function Plans : It is seen that the relevant departments start constituting teams/mobilizing resources only after the crisis/disaster  has  struck,  leading  to  delays.  The  relevant  departments/agencies have  been  asked  to  draw  up  Emergency  Support  Function  (ESF)  Plans  and constitute response teams and designate resources in advance so that response is not  delayed.    Ministries/  Departments  have  drawn  up  their  ESF  Plans  and communicated  it  to  MHA.  States  have  also  been  asked  to  take  similar  steps. Similarly  States  have  been  advised  to  finalize  pre-contract/agreement  for  all disaster relief items so as to avoid delays in procuring relief items after disaster situations.

4.11 India Disaster Resource Network: A  web-enabled centralised  data  base for the India Disaster Resource Network has been operationalized.  The IDRN is a nation-wide electronic inventory of essential and specialist resources for disaster response both specialist equipment and specialist manpower resources.  The IDRN list out the equipments and the resources by type and by the functions it performs and it gives the contact address and telephone numbers of the controlling officers in-charge of the said resources. The IDRN is a live system providing for updating of inventory once in every quarter.  Entries into the inventory are made at district and  State  level.    The  network  ensures  quick  access  to  resources  to  minimise response time in emergencies.  The list of resources to be updated in the system has  been  finalized.    It  has  226  items.  About  69,329  records  in  545  districts throughout  the  country  have  already      been  uploaded  since  September  1,  2003 when the India Disaster Resource Network was formally inaugurated.  The system will  give,  at  the  touch  of  the  button,  location  of  specific  equipments/specialist resources as well as   the Controlling authority for that resource so that it can be mobilized  for  response  in  the  shortest  possible  time.    The  data  base  will  be available simultaneously at the district, state and national levels.

4.12 Emergency  Operation  Centres: The  States  are  being  assisted  to  set  up control rooms/emergency  operations  centres  at  the  State  and  district level. Assistance  for  this  is  being  given  under  the  GOI  -  UNDP  project  in  the  States covered by the project. Assistance under the Modernization of Police Scheme is also available for setting up EOCs.   The control rooms, which will function round the clock, will be composite control rooms to look after law and order issues as well  as  disaster  management.        Equipments  are  also  being  provided  for  these control rooms under the disaster risk management programme  Hazard zone-wise . standard layout, structural design and construction drawings have been developed for State and District EOCs and shared with all the States. Construction work has stated for multi-hazard resistant EOCs in six States and 64 districts.

4.13 National Emergency Operation Centre: To coordinate the entire disaster/emergency  operations  effectively,  the  existing  Control  Room  at  the national level has been  being upgraded as National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC). The National EOC is equipped with satellite phones, GPS, computers, emergency lights, GIS information system etc in five on-site emergency coordination kits in ready-to-use mode.  Staffs in the NEOC have been trained. A State-of-the-art underground and all-hazard resistant, National EOC with superior structural features and communication facilities is being set up. A Committee of CPWD/BARC/DRDO has been constituted to finalize the design parameters. It is likely to be commissioned by 2006.

4.14 National  Emergency  Communication  Network: The  communication network between the national and the state EOCs  and the site of the emergency/crises are currently based on the DOT network. It has been observed that  in  a  calamity/hazard,  communication  is  the  first  casualty.  It  has  therefore been  decided  to  put  in  place  multi-mode  and  multi-channel  communication systems  so  that  enough  redundancy  is  available.  It  has  been  decided  that  the POLNET will also be used for disaster  management; and for  this  the  POLNET communication facility will be extended to SDMs and Collectors as well as the Emergency Operation Centers.  For emergency communications, discussions have also  been  held  with  the  Department  of  Space  (ISRO).    They  will  be  making available alternate satellite communication units to connect with State EOCs and mobile units which can be transported to the site of a disaster.  A Group had been set up for drawing up a communication plan for disaster management and the said Group  has  submitted  its  report.    This  provides  for  a  dedicated  communication system  for  disaster  management  with  built  in  redundancies.    Phase  I  of  the National  Disaster  Management  Communication  Plan  to  provide  satellite  based mobile  voice/data/video      communication  between  National  EOC/State  EOCs/

mobile EOCs and remote disaster/emergency sites is under implementation and is expected to be completed by October, 2004. Phase II of the communication plan to connect National/State/District EOCs with disaster/emergency sites is proposed to be  completed  by  March,  2006.  The  communication  backbone  to  be  used  will include terrestrial link (DOT), POLNET, NICNET, ISDN and SPACENET

4.15 Development of a GIS-based National Database for Disaster Management: The  Geographical  Information  System  (GIS)  data  base    is  an effective    tool    for  emergency  responders  to  access    information  in  terms  of crucial parameters for the disaster  affected  areas.  The crucial parameters include location of the public facilities, communication links and transportation network at national,  state  and  district  levels.    The  GIS  data  base  already  available  with different agencies of the Government is being upgraded and the gaps are proposed to  be  bridged.    A  project  for  this  purpose  is  being  drawn  up  with  a  view  to institutionalize the arrangements.  The data base will provide multi layered maps on district wise basis.  These maps taken in conjunction with the satellite images available  for  a  particular  area  will  enable  the  district  administration  as  well  as State Governments to carry out hazard zonation and vulnerability assessment, as well as coordinate response after a disaster. Recognizing the crucial importance of Geographical Information System (GIS) as a decision support tool for  disaster  management,  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  proposes  to  establish  a GIS database, 'National Database for Disaster Management (NDDM)', which will assist in hazard zonation, risk assessment, preparedness and emergency response management.

4.16 Strengthening of Fire Services: In order to further strengthen the capacity for  response,    the  fire  services  are  proposed  to  be  developed    into  multi  hazard response units as is the normal practice  in several other countries A project for this (with an estimated cost of Rs 2457 crores) has been drawn up. The Planning

Commission  has  given  in-principle  clearance  to  the  project.    The  exercise  for mobilization  of  resources  is  being  undertaken.  It  is  proposed  to  provide  rescue tenders in addition to fire tenders to each fire unit and fill up all gaps upto   subdivisional level.  Hazmat vans will be provided to State   capitals and metropolitan cities.    This  will  necessitate  recruitment  of  additional  fire  men  and  drivers  and intensive training required to be provided to enable them to function as efficient of all purpose response units.

- 4.17 Strengthening of Civil Defence: India has a large network of Civil Defence and  Home  Guards  volunteers.    The  existing  strength  is  about  1.2  million. However, this organization has not so far been associated with disaster mitigation, preparedness and response functions.  It is proposed to revamp the Civil Defence organization to enable them to discharge a key responsibility in all the facets   of disaster management including preparedness.  A proposal in this regard has been finalized and is under consideration of the Government.
- 4.18 Handling of Hazardous Materials ;  In  the  light  of  the  experience  of  the Bhopal  Gas  Tragedy,  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  has  been  interacting  with Ministry  of  Environment  &amp;  Forests  and  new  guidelines  have  been  sent  to  the States  for  industries  handling  hazardous  materials.    It  has  been  prescribed  that onsite and offsite disaster response plans for the industries dealing with hazardous material be updated in consultation with District Administration and that this may be rehearsed once every year.  It has also been prescribed that these industries will carry  out  awareness  campaign  for  the  population  in  the  vicinity  regarding  the dos/don'ts in case of any accident involving hazardous material
- 4.19 With the development   of disaster management   committees and disaster management teams at all levels including village/urban local body/ward level, the

stage  will  be      set  for  comprehensive  preparedness  measures  to  be  taken  with active participation of the community and non-governmental organizations.

4.20 Special Focus to Northeastern States :  A  special  focus is being given to North-Eastern  States  and  the  Andaman  &amp;  Nicobar  Islands.    The  North-Eastern Council has been made the nodal agency for the NE States. The NEC has been provided  with  a  resource  person/advisor  in  disaster  management.    A  detailed presentation on the vulnerabilities of the NE region and the need for comprehensive disaster management plan has been made in the Governing Body of  NE  Council.  An  action  plan  has  been  drawn  up  by  NEC  and  a  declaration namely 'Shillong Declaration' has been adopted by States in the NE region for integrating  disaster  management with development planning.   140 officials  and non-officials  have been trained in disaster management to act as resource persons for the NE region.  State and district level sensitization and training programmes are being carried out.

4.21 With the mitigation and preparedness measures outlined in this and earlier section  in  position,  it  is  expected  that  natural  hazards  could  be  handled  more efficiently so as to ensure that these hazards did not get converted into disasters.

## SECTION V

## Conclusion

- 5.1 Disaster Management requires multi-disciplinary and pro-active approach. Besides various measures for putting in place institutional and policy framework, disaster  prevention,  mitigation  and  preparedness  enunciated  in  this  paper  and initiatives being taken by the Central and State Governments, the community, civil society organizations and media also have a key role to play in achieving our goal of moving together, towards a safer India. The message being put across is that, in order to move towards safer and sustainable national development, development projects should be sensitive towards disaster mitigation.
- 5.2 Our mission is vulnerability reduction to all types of hazards, be it natural or  manmade.  This  is  not  an  easy  task  to  achieve,  keeping  in  view  the  vast population,  and  the  multiple  natural  hazards  to  which  this  country  is  exposed. However, if we are firm in our conviction and resolve that the Government and the people  of  this  country  are  not  prepared  to  pay  the  price  in  terms  of  massive casualties  and  economic  losses,  the  task,  though  difficult,  is  achievable  and  we shall achieve it.
- 5.3 We  have  taken  the  first  few  but  significant  steps  towards  vulnerability reduction, putting in place prevention and mitigation measures and preparedness for  a  rapid  and  professional  response.  With  a  massive  awareness  generation campaign  and  building  up  of  capabilities  as  well  as  institutionalization  of  the entire mechanism through a techno legal and techno financial framework, we are gradually moving in the direction of sustainable development.
- 5.4 The various  prevention,  mitigation  measures  outlined  above  are  aimed  at building  up  the  capabilities  of  the  communities,  voluntary  organisations  and Government functionaries at all levels. Particular stress is being laid on ensuring that  these  measures  are  institutionalized  considering  the  vast  population  and  the

geographical  area  of  the  country.  This  is  a  major  task  being  undertaken  by  the Government to put in place mitigation measures for vulnerability reduction. This is just a beginning. The ultimate goal is to make prevention and mitigation a part of normal day-to-day life.. We have a firm conviction that with these measures in place,  we could say with confidence that disasters like Orissa cyclone and Bhuj earthquake  will  not  be  allowed  to  recur  in  this  country;  at  least  not  at  the  cost, which  the  country  has  paid  in  these  two  disasters  in  terms  of  human  lives, livestock, loss of property and means of livelihood.

- 5.5 Our  vision  2020  is  to  build  a  safer  and  secure  India  through  sustained collective  effort,  synergy  of  national  capacities  and  people's  participation.  What looks a dream today will be transformed into reality in the next two decades. This is our goal and we shall strive to achieve this goal with a missionary zeal. The path ahead,  which  looks  difficult  today,  will  become  a  lot  easier  as  we  move  along together.

## MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS [NDM DIVISION ]

- 1. A review of  the  disaster  management  mechanism  was  carried  out  by  the Government of India after the Bhuj earthquake.    It was noted that there was need for building up holistic capabilities for disaster management - so as to be able to handle both natural and man-made disasters.  It was accordingly decided that the subject of Disaster Management be transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture to the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (excluding  drought  and  epidemics  and  those emergencies/disasters  which  were  specifically  allotted  to  other  Ministries).    The Government (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 were accordingly amended in February, 2002.  The actual transfer of work took place in June, 2002.
- 2. India has been very vulnerable to natural hazards and calamities.  The Bhuj earthquake accounted for 13805 deaths, the super cyclone in Orissa accounted for 9885 deaths.  Government are of the view that if appropriate mitigation measures had been taken these casualties could have been reduced significantly.
- 3. Each year disasters also account for loss of thousands of crores in terms of social and community assets.  It is clear that development cannot be sustainable without  building  in  mitigation  into  the  planning  process.      Keeping  the  above factors in view, the Government of India have brought about a change in policy which emphasizes mitigation, prevention and preparedness.  With the approval of the Government, a strategic roadmap as given in the succeeding pages has been drawn up for reducing the country's vulnerability to disasters.  Action for reducing our vulnerabilities to disasters shall be taken in accordance with the roadmap. The roadmap  will  be  reviewed  every  two  years  to  see  if  any  change  in  direction  is necessary.

## DISASTER MANAGEMENT THE DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE

- 1. Five Year Plan documents have, historically, not included consideration of issues  relating to the management  and  mitigation  of  natural  disasters.  The traditional  perception  has  been  limited  to  the  idea  of  'calamity  relief',  which  is seen essentially as a non-plan item of expenditure. However, the impact of major disasters cannot be mitigated by the provision of immediate relief alone, which is the primary focus of calamity relief efforts. Disasters can have devastating effects on the economy;  they cause huge human  and  economic  losses, and can significantly  set  back  development  efforts  of  a  region  or  a  State.  Two  recent disasters, the Orissa Cyclone and the Gujarat Earthquake, are cases in point. With the kind of economic losses and developmental setbacks that the country has been suffering year after year, the development process needs to be sensitive towards disaster prevention and mitigation aspects. There is thus need to look at disasters from a development perspective as well.

Further,  although  disaster  management  is  not  generally  associated  with plan financing, there are in fact a number of plan schemes in operation, such as for drought proofing, afforestation, drinking water, etc., which deal with the prevention and mitigation of the impact of natural disasters. External assistance for post-disaster  reconstruction  and  streamlining  of  management  structures  also  is  a part of the Plan. A specific, centrally sponsored scheme on disaster management also exists. The Plan thus already has a defined role in dealing with the subject.
- 3. Recently, expert bodies have dwelt on the role of the Planning Commission  and  the  use  of  plan  funds  in  the  context  of  disaster  management. Suggestions have been made in this regard by the Eleventh Finance Commission,

and also the High Powered Committee on Disaster Management. An approach on planning for safe development needs to be set out in the light of these suggestions.

- 4. This chapter reflects the considerations outlined above. It briefly outlines the global context and the Indian experience of disasters, sets out the institutional and  financial  arrangements  for  disaster  management  and  the  response  towards these  in  the  country,  looks  at  directions  for  improvement,  and  concludes  with  a strategy  to  facilitate  planning  for  safe  national  development  in  the  Tenth  Plan period.

## THE GLOBAL CONTEXT

- 5. There has been an increase in the number of natural disasters over the past years,  and  with  it,  increasing  losses  on  account  of  urbanisation  and  population growth, as a result of which the impact of natural disasters is now felt to a larger extent.  According  to  the  United  Nations,  in  2001  alone,  natural  disasters  of medium to high range caused at least 25,000 deaths around the world, more than double the previous year, and economic losses of around US $ 36 billion. These figures  would  be  much  higher,  if  the  consequences  of  the  many  smaller  and unrecorded  disasters  that  cause  significant  losses  at  the  local  community  level were  to  be  taken  into  account.  Devastations  in  the  aftermath  of  powerful earthquakes that struck Gujarat, El Salvador and Peru; floods that ravaged many countries  in  Africa,  Asia  and  elsewhere;  droughts  that  plagued  Central  Asia including  Afghanistan,  Africa  and  Central  America;  the  cyclone  in  Madagascar and Orissa; and floods in Bolivia are global events in recent memory. However, what is disturbing is the knowledge that these trends of destruction and devastation are on the rise instead of being kept in check.
- 6. Natural disasters are not bound by political boundaries and have no social or  economic  considerations.  They  are  borderless  as  they  affect  both  developing

and developed countries. They are also merciless, and as such the vulnerable tend to  suffer  more  at  the  impact  of  natural  disasters.  For  example,  the  developing countries are much more seriously affected in terms of the loss of lives, hardship borne by population and the percentage of their GNP lost. Since 1991, two-third of the victims of natural disasters were from developing countries, while just 2 per cent were from highly developed nations. Those living in developing countries and especially those with limited resources tend to be more adversely affected. With the  alarming  rise  in  the  natural  disasters  and  vulnerability  per  se,  the  world community is strengthening its efforts to cope with it.

- 7. As a number of the most vulnerable regions are in India, natural disaster management  has  emerged  as  a  high  priority  for  the  country.  Going  beyond  the historical focus on relief and rehabilitation after the event, we now have to look ahead and plan for disaster preparedness and mitigation, in order that the periodic shocks to our development efforts are minimized.

## THE INDIAN EXPERIENCE Regional Vulnerabilities

- 8. Physical  vulnerability  relates  to  the  physical  location  of  people,  their proximity  to  the  hazard  zone  and  standards  of  safety  maintained  to  counter  the effects. For instance, some people are vulnerable to flood only because they live in a flood prone area. Physical vulnerability also relates to the technical capacity of buildings  and  structures  to  resist  the  forces  acting  upon  them  during  a  hazard event.

## 71 INDIA S KEY VULNERABILITIES Box

Gujarat are vulnerable to cyclones

- 68 per cent of net sown area Is vulnerable t0 drought ,
- 55 per cent of total area is in Seismic Zones Il V and vulnerable to earthquakes
- landslides

- 9. The  extent  to  which  a  population  is affected  by  a  calamity  does  not  purely  lie  in the  physical  components of vulnerability, but is  contextual also to the prevailing social and economic  conditions  and  it's  consequential

effect  on  human  activities  within  a  given  society.  Research  in  areas  affected  by earthquakes  indicates  that  single  parent  families,  women,  handicapped  people, children and the aged are particularly vulnerable social groups. The geophysical setting  with  unplanned  and  inadequate  developmental  activity  is  a  cause  for increased  losses  during  disasters.  In  the  case  of  India,  the  contribution  of  overpopulation to high population density, which in turn results in escalating losses, deserves to be noted. This factor sometimes tends to be as important as physical vulnerability attributed to geography and infrastructure alone.

- 10. The continent of Asia is particularly vulnerable to disaster strikes. Between the  years  1991  to  2000  Asia  has  accounted  for  83  per  cent  of  the  population affected by disasters globally. While the number of people affected in the rest of the  world  were  1,11,159,  in  Asia  the  number  was  5,54,439.Within  Asia,  24  per cent of deaths due to disasters occur in India, on account of its size, population and vulnerability.  Floods  and  high  winds  account  for  60  per  cent  of  all  disasters  in India.  While  substantial  progress  has  been  made  in  other  sectors  of  human development, there is need to do more towards mitigating the effect of disasters.
- 11. Many parts of the Indian sub-continent are susceptible to different types of disasters owing to the unique topographic and climatic characteristics. About 54 per cent of the sub-continent's landmass is vulnerable to earthquakes while about 4 crore hectares is vulnerable to periodic floods. The decade 1990-2000, has been one of very high disaster losses within the country, losses in the Orissa Cyclone in 1999, and later, the Gujarat Earthquake in 2001 alone amount to several thousand crore of Rupees, while the total expenditure on relief and reconstruction in Gujarat alone has been to the tune of Rs 11,500 crore.
- 12. Similarly,  the  country  has  suffered  four  major  earthquakes  in  the  span  of last  fifty  years  along  with  a  series  of  moderate  intensity  earthquakes  that  have

occurred  at  regular  intervals.  Since  1988,  six  earthquakes  have  struck  different parts of the country. These caused considerable human and property losses.

Table 7.1 Major Earthquakes in India, 1988-2001

- 13. Disasters lead to enormous economic losses that are both immediate  as  well  as  long  term  in nature and demand additional revenues.  Also,  as  an  immediate  fallout, disasters reduce revenues from the

affected region due to lower levels of economic activity leading to loss of direct and indirect taxes. In addition, unplanned budgetary allocation to disaster recovery can hamper development interventions and lead to unmet developmental targets.

- 14. Disasters may also reduce availability of new investment, further constricting  the  growth  of  the  region.  Besides,  additional  pressures  may  be imposed  on  finances  of  the  government  through  investments  in  relief  and rehabilitation work.
- 15. In the recent earthquake in Gujarat, more  than  14,000  lives  were  lost,  ten  lakh houses  were  damaged  and  the  asset  loss  has been indicated to be worth 15,000 crore. Tables 7.2 to 7.5 give an indication of the magnitude of the  damage and losses incurred by the country in recent natural disasters.

## Global Losses Through Natural Disasters

According t0 Reinsurance Company 'Munich Each year from seven times greater than te figure for those killed or afleded by conllid natural hazards than conflict

- 16. The dimensions of the damage, as evident in the tables and the diagram 7.1 emphasise  the  point  that  natural  disasters  cause  major  setbacks  to  development

and  it  is  the  poorest  and  the  weakest  that  are  the  most  vulnerable  to  disasters. Given the high frequency with which one or the other part of the country suffers due to disasters, mitigating the impact of disasters must be an integral component of our development planning and be part of our poverty reduction strategy.

## INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS

- 17. The country with its federal system of Government has specific roles for the  Central and State Governments. However, the subject of disaster management does not specifically find

mention in any of the three lists in the 7th Schedule of the Indian Constitution, where  subjects  under  the  Central  and  State  Governments  as  also  subjects  that come under both are specified. On the legal front, there is no enactment either of the Central or of any State Government to deal with the management of disasters of various types in a comprehensive manner.

- 18. The country has an integrated administrative machinery for management of disasters at the National,  State, District and  Sub-District  levels.  The  basic responsibility of undertaking rescue, relief and rehabilitation measures in the event of natural disasters, as at present, is that of the State Governments concerned. The Central Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing financial and logistic support.

## Central Level

- 19. The  dimensions  of  response  at  the  level  of  the  Central  Government  are determined in accordance with the existing policy of financing relief expenditure and keeping in view the factors like:

- (i) the gravity of a natural disaster;
- (ii) the scale of the relief operation necessary; and
- (iii) the requirements of Central assistance for augmenting financial resources and logistic support at the disposal of the State Government.
- 20. The  Contingency  Action  Plan  (CAP)  identifies  initiatives  required  to  be taken by various Central Ministries and Public Departments in the wake of natural calamities.  It  sets  down  the  procedures  and  determines  the  focal  points  in  the administrative  machinery  to  facilitate  launching  of  relief  and  rescue  operations without delay.
- 21. The  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  is  the  nodal  Ministry  for  coordination  of relief and response and overall natural disaster management, and the Department of  Agriculture  &amp;  Cooperation  is  the  nodal  Ministry  for  drought  management. Other Ministries are assigned the responsibility of providing emergency support in case of disasters that fall in their purview as indicated in Table 7.6.

Table 7.6 Ministries Responsible for Various Categories of Disasters

| Dsaster        |
|----------------|
| Managurnent    |
| Drought Relier |

The  following  decision-making  and  standing bodies are responsible for disaster management at the Central level:

- · Union Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister.
- ·  Empowered Group of Ministers, headed by the Deputy Prime Minister
- · National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC), under the chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary.
- · Crisis Management Group (CMG): under the chairmanship of the Central Relief Commissioner  comprising  senior  officers  from  the  various  Ministries  and  other

concerned Departments which reviews contingency plans, measures required for dealing  with  a  natural  disaster,  and  co-ordinates  the  activities  of  the  Central Ministries and the State Governments in relation to disaster preparedness response and relief.

- · Technical Organizations, such as the Indian Meteorological Department (cyclone/earthquake), Central Water Commission (floods), Building and Material Promotion  Council  (construction  laws),  Bureau  of  Indian  Standards  (norms), Defence Research &amp; Development Organization (nuclear/biological), Directorate General  Civil  Defence  provide  specific  technical  support  to  coordination  of disaster response and management functions.
- · The setting up of a National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is being contemplated  by  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  as  the  proposed  apex  structure within  the  government  for  the  purpose.  Amongst  other  major  organizational initiatives, it is proposed to:
- (a) establish a specialised and earmarked response team for dealing with nuclear/ biological/chemical disasters;
- (b) establish search and rescue teams in each State;
- (c) strengthen communication systems in the North Eastern Region.

## State Government

- 22. The responsibility to cope with natural disasters is essentially that of the State Government. The role of the Central Government is supportive in terms of supplementation of physical and financial resources.  The  Chief  Secretary  of  the State  heads  a  state  level  committee  which  is  in  overall  charge  of  the  relief operations  in  the  State  and  the  Relief  Commissioners  who  are  in  charge  of  the relief  and  rehabilitation  measures  in  the  wake  of  natural  disasters  in  their  States function  under  the  overall  direction  and  control  of  the  state  level  committee.  In many states, Secretary, Department of Revenue, is also in-charge of relief. State Governments usually have relief manuals and the districts have their contingency plan that is updated from time to time.

## District and Local Level

- 23. The  district  administration  is  the  focal  point  for  implementation  of  all governmental plans and activities. The actual day-to-day function of administering relief is the responsibility of the Collector/ District Magistrate/Deputy Commissioner  who  exercises  coordinating  and  supervising  powers  over  all departments at the district level. Though it may not be a common phenomenon, there exists by and large in districts also a district level relief committee consisting of officials and non- officials.
- 24. The  73rd  and  74th  constitutional  amendments  recognise  Panchayati  Raj Institutions  as  'Institutions  of  self-  government'.  The  amendment  has  also  laid down  necessary  guidelines for the structure of their composition, powers, functions, devolution of finances, regular holding of elections and reservation of seats  for  weaker  sections  including  women.  These  local  bodies  can  be  effective instruments in tackling disasters through early warning system, relief distribution, providing shelter to the victims, medical assistance etc.
- 25. Other  than  the  national,  state,  district  and  local  levels,  there  are  various institutional  stakeholders  who  are  involved  in  disaster  management  at  various levels  in  the  country.  These  include  the  police  and  para-military  forces,  civil defence and home-guards, fire services, ex-servicemen, nongovernment organisations  (NGOs),  public  and  private  sector  enterprises,  media  and  HAM operators, all of whom have important roles to play.

## Armed Forces

- 26. The Indian Armed Forces are supposed to be called upon to intervene and take  on  specific  tasks  only  when  the  situation  is  beyond  the  capability  of  civil administration.  In  practice,  the  Armed  Forces  are  the  core  of  the  government's response capacity and tend to be the first responders of the Government of India in

- a  major  disaster.  Due  to  their  ability  to  organize  action  in  adverse  ground circumstances, speed of operational response and the resources and capabilities at their disposal, the Armed  Forces  have  historically  played  a  major  role  in emergency support functions such as communications, search and rescue operations,  health  and  medical  facilities,  transportation,  power,  food  and  civil supplies, public works and engineering, especially in the immediate aftermath of disaster. Disaster management plans should incorporate the role expected of them so that the procedure for deploying them is smooth and quick.

## External Linkages

- 27. The Government of India is a member of various international organisations  in  the  field  of  disaster  response  and  relief.  While,  as  a  policy,  no requests for assistance or appeals are made to the international community in the event of a disaster, assistance offered suo moto is accepted. Linkages exist with the following organisations:
- a) UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), which has been  made  responsible  by  UN  General  Assembly  mandate  for  all  international disaster response.
- b)  United  Nations  Development Programme (UNDP), responsible for mitigation and prevention aspects of disaster management.
- c) UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) System.

Streamlining Institutional Arrangements for Disaster Response

- 28. Institutional  arrangements  for  disaster  response  are  the  heart  of  disaster management systems. There is no dearth of personnel, both civilian and military, experienced in handling situations arising out of natural disasters. However, there certainly  is  a  pressing  need  for  improvement  and  strengthening  of  existing institutional arrangements and systems in this regard to make the initial response to a disaster more effective and professional. Most of the resources and expertise

needed already exist with the Government. What needs to be streamlined is how they should be integrated, trained and deployed. Some of the areas where improvement is urgently needed are:

- a)  Integrated  planning  for  disasters,  including  the  integration  of  relevant  Armed Forces formations into disaster management planning at all levels from District to State and Central Government.
- b)  Setting  up  of  a  modern,  permanent  national  command  centre  or  operations room,  with  redundant  communications  and  data  links  to  all  State  capitals.  The national  command  centre  or  operations  room  needs  to  be  manned  on  a  24-hour basis by professionals to cater for instant integrated response. There needs to be a properly equipped operations room at the State level as well.
- c) Establishment  of  a  national  stand  by,  quick  reaction  team  composed  of experienced  professionals,  both  military  and  civilian,  drawn  from  Central  and State Government staff to respond immediately by flying in a matter of hours an experienced response team to the locations when a disaster strikes. This team can be  organized  and  run  professionally  on  the  same  lines  as  the  United  Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams.
- d) Creation of urban search and rescue capacity at all levels, by establishing a fully equipped Search and Rescue unit, as part of the fire service in all State capitals, with  trained  staff  and  modern  equipment  such  as  thermal  imagers,  acoustic detection  devices  etc.  This  is  of  immediate  relevance  since  a  major  weakness exposed  in  the  Gujarat  earthquake  was  a  lack  of  specialised  urban  search  and rescue capability in India.
- e) Media  policy  geared  to  handling  the  growing  phenomenon  of  real  time television reporting, which generates enormous political pressures on a government to respond rapidly and efficiently. This needs attention since the effect is going to increase, not decrease in future.

- f)  Closer  interface  with  and  better  understanding  of  the  international  system  for disaster  response,  and  putting  in  place,  systems  for  dealing  with  international assistance once it comes in e.g., customs, immigration, foreign policy implications etc.  A  greater  appreciation  is  needed  of  the  speed  and  automation  of  modern international response to a natural disaster. Closer interaction is required between of  the  Ministry  of  External  Affairs  and  the  relevant  inter-national  agencies concerned with disaster response.
- g) Standard procedures for dealing with domestic humanitarian and relief assistance from non-government sources. Procedures and systems need to be set out to avoid confusion and ensure best utilisation of the assistance being offered, just as in the case of systems for international assistance.
- h)  Modern  unified  legislation  for  disaster  management.  In  view  of  the  current division of responsibilities between the State and Central Government into state, central and concurrent lists, there is a need to create a body of legislation dealing with  response  to  natural  disasters  and  other  emergencies,  clearly  delineating responsibilities and powers of each entity and specifying what powers or actions would need to be triggered on declaration of a disaster by the Government of India or  a  State  Government.  This  legislation  should  also  incorporate  the  current legislation  dealing  with  chemical  emergencies  that  has  been  created  by  the Ministry of Environment so that all emergencies are dealt with under one law. The legislation  should  include  clear  definitions  of  what  constitutes  a  disaster  at  a national level.

## FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS

## Financing of Relief Expenditures

- 29. The policy arrangements for meeting relief  expenditure  related  to  natural disasters are, by and large, based on the recommendations of successive finance commissions. The two main windows presently open for meeting such

expenditures are the Calamity Relief Fund  (CRF)  and National Calamity Contingency  Fund  (NCCF).  The  Calamity  Relief  Fund  is  used  for  meeting  the expenditure  for  providing  immediate  relief  to  the  victims  of  cyclone,  drought, earthquake,  fire,  flood  and  hailstorm.  Expenditure  on  restoration  of  damaged capital works should ordinarily be met from the normal budgetary heads, except when it is to be incurred as part of providing immediate relief, such as restoration of drinking water sources or provision of shelters etc., or restoration of communication  links  for  facilitating  relief  operations.  The  amount  of  annual contribution to the CRF of each State for each of the financial years 2000-01 to 2004-05  is  as  indicated  by  the  Finance  Commission.  Of  the  total  contribution indicated,  the  Government  of  India  contributes  75  per  cent  of  the  total  yearly allocation in the form of a non-plan grant, and the balance amount is contributed by the State Government concerned. A total of Rs. 11,007.59 crore was provided for the Calamity Relief Fund from 2000-05.

- 30. Pursuant  to  the    recommendations  of  the  Eleventh  Finance  Commission, apart  from  the  CRF,  a  National  Calamity  Contingency  Fund  (NCCF)  Scheme came  into  force  with  effect  from  the  financial  year  2000-01  and  would  be operative  till  the  end  of  the  financial  year  2004-05.  NCCF  is  intended  to  cover natural  calamities  like  cyclone,  drought,  earthquake,  fire,  flood  and  hailstorm, which  are  considered  to  be  of  severe  nature  requiring  expenditure  by  the  State Government in excess of the balances available in its own Calamity Relief Fund. The assistance from NCCF  is available only for immediate relief and rehabilitation.  Any  reconstruction  of  assets  or  restoration  of  damaged  capital should be financed through re-allocation of Plan funds. There is need for defining the arrangements in this regard.
- 31. The initial  corpus  of  the  National  Fund  is  Rs.500  crore,  provided  by  the Government  of  India.  This  fund  is  required  to  be  recouped  by  levy  of  special surcharge for a limited period on central taxes. An amount of about Rs.2,300 crore

has  already  been  released  to  States  from  NCCF.  A  list  of  items  and  norms  of expenditure  for  assistance  chargeable  to  CRF/NCCF  in  the  wake  of  natural calamities is prescribed in detail from time to time.

## Financing of Disaster Management Through Five Year Plans

- 32. Although  not  specifically  addressed  in  Five  Year  Plan  documents  in  the past, the Government of India has a long history of using funds from the Plan for mitigating natural disasters. Funds are provided under Plan schemes i.e., various schemes  of  Government  of  India,  such  as  for  drinking  water,  employment generation, inputs for agriculture and flood control measures etc. There are also facilities  for  rescheduling  short-term  loans  taken  for  agriculture  purposes  upon certification  by  the  District/State  administration.  Central  Government's  assets/ infrastructure are to be repaired/rectified by the respective Ministry/Department of Government  of  India.  Besides  this,  at  the  occurrence  of  a  calamity  of  great magnitude,  funds  flow  from  donors,  both  local  and  international,  for  relief  and rehabilitation, and in few cases for long-term preparedness/ preventive measures. Funds for the latter purposes are also available from multilateral funding agencies such as the World Bank. These form part of the State Plan.
- 33. There  are  also  a  number  of  important  ongoing  schemes  that  specifically help  reduce  disaster  vulnerability.  Some  of  these  are:  Integrated  Wasteland Development  Programme  (IWDP),  Drought  Prone  Area  Programme  (DPAP), Desert  Development  Programme  (DDP),  Flood  Control  Programmes,  National Afforestation  &amp;    Ecodevelopment  Programme  (NA&amp;ED),  Accelerated  Rural Water Supply Programme (ARWSP), Crop Insurance, Sampurn Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY), Food for Work etc.

## Initiatives Proposed by Various Bodies Regarding Financing Under the

## Plan

- 34. References  have  recently  been  made  to  the  role  of  the  Plan  in  disaster management by the High Power Committee (HPC) on Disaster Management, as well as by the Eleventh Finance Commission. The HPC was constituted in 1999 and submitted its Report in October 2001. The HPC took an overview of all recent disasters  (natural  as  well  as  manmade)  in  the  country  and  identified  common response and preparedness mechanisms on the basis of a series of consultations with a number  of  government,  non-government,  national and international agencies and media organisations. An important recommendation of the Committee was that at least 10 per cent of plan funds at the national, state and district  levels  be  earmarked  and  apportioned  for  schemes  which  specifically address  areas  such  as  prevention,  reduction,  preparedness  and  mitigation  of disasters.
- 35. The Eleventh Finance Commission too paid detailed attention to the issue of  disaster  management  and,  in  its  chapter  on  calamity  relief,  came  out  with  a number of recommendations, of which the following have a direct bearing on the Plan:
- (a)  Expenditure  on  restoration  of  infrastructure  and  other  capital  assets,  except those that are intrinsically connected with relief operations and connectivity with the  affected  area  and  population,  should  be  met  from  the  plan  funds  on  priority basis.
- (b) Medium and long-term measures be devised by the concerned Ministries of the Government  of  India,  the  State  Governments  and  the  Planning  Commission  to reduce, and if possible, eliminate, the occurrences of these calamities by undertaking developmental works.

- (c)  The  Planning  Commission,  in  consultation  with  the  State  Governments  and concerned  Ministries,  should  be  able  to  identify  works  of  a  capital  nature  to prevent the recurrence of specific calamities. These works may be funded under the Plan.

## PLANNING FOR SAFE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

- 36. Development programmes that go into promoting development at the local level have been left to the general exercise of planning. Measures need also to be taken  to  integrate  disaster  mitigation  efforts  at  the  local  level  with  the  general exercise  of  planning,  and  a  more  supportive  environment  created  for  initiatives towards managing of disasters at all levels: national, state, district and local. The future  blue-print  for  disaster  management  in  India  rests  on  the  premise  that  in today's  society  while  hazards,  both  natural  or  otherwise,  are  inevitable,  the disasters that follow need not be so and the society can be prepared to cope with them effectively whenever they occur. The need of the hour is to chalk out a multipronged strategy for total risk management, comprising prevention, preparedness, response  and  recovery  on  the  one  hand,  and  initiate  development  efforts  aimed towards  risk  reduction  and  mitigation,  on  the  other    Only  then  can  we  look forward to 'sustainable development.'

## Disaster Prevention  And  Preparedness  Measures  Information  and Research Network

- 37. Disaster prevention is intrinsically linked to preventive planning. Some of the important steps in this regard are:
- (a) Introduction of a comprehensive process of vulnerability analysis and objective risk assessment.

- (b) Building a robust and sound information database: A comprehensive database of  the  land  use,  demography,  infrastructure  developed  at  the  national,  state  and local  levels  along  with  current  information  on  climate,  weather  and  man-made structures is crucial in planning, warning and assessment of disasters. In addition, resource  inventories  of  governmental  and  non-governmental  systems  including personnel  and  equipment  help  in  efficient  mobilisation  and  optimisation  of response measures.
- (c)  Creating  state-of-the-art  infrastructure:  The  entire  disaster  mitigation  game plan  must  necessarily  be  anchored  to  frontline  research  and  development  in  a holistic mode. State-of-the art technologies available worldwide need to be made available in India for upgradation of the disaster management system; at the same time,  dedicated  research  activities  should  be  encouraged,  in  all  frontier  areas related  to  disasters  like  biological,  space  applications,  information  technology, nuclear  radiation etc., for a continuous flow of high quality basic information for sound disaster management planning,
- (d) Establishing Linkages between all knowledge- based institutions: A National Disaster Knowledge Network, tuned to the felt needs of a multitude of users like disaster  managers,  decision  makers,  community  etc.,  must  be  developed  as  the network of networks to cover natural, manmade and biological disasters in all their varied dimensions,

## Capacity Building, Training &amp; Education

- 38. Personnel involved in the exercise have to draw upon knowledge of best practices  and  resources  available  to  them.  Information  and  training  on  ways  to better respond to and mitigate disasters to the responders go a long way in building the capacity and resilience of the country to reduce and prevent disasters. Training is an integral part of capacity building as trained personnel respond much better to

different disasters and appreciate the need for preventive measures. The directions in this regard are:

- (a)  The  multi-sectoral  and  multi-hazard  prevention  based  approach  to  disaster management requires specific professional inputs. Professional training in disaster management should be built into the existing pedagogic research and education. Specialised courses for disaster management may be developed by universities and professional teaching institutions, and disaster management should be treated as a distinct academic  and  professional  discipline,  something  that  the  American education  system  has  done  successfully.  In  addition  to  separate  diploma/degree courses in disaster management, the subject needs to be discussed  and taught as a specific component in professional and specialised courses like medicine, nursing, engineering, environmental sciences, architecture, and town and country planning.
- (b)  The  focus  towards  preventive  disaster  management  and  development  of  a national  ethos  of  prevention  calls  for  an  awareness  generation  at  all  levels.  An appropriate component of disaster awareness at the school level will help increase awareness among children and, in many cases, parents and other family members through these children. Curriculum development with a focus towards dissemination of disaster related information on a sustained basis, covering junior, middle and high schools may be worked out by the different school boards in the country.
- (c) Training facilities for government personnel involved in disaster management are conducted at the national level by the National Centre for Disaster Management  (NCDM)  at  the  Indian  Institute  of  Public  Administration,  in  New Delhi which functions as the nodal institution in the country for training, research and  documentation  of  disasters.  At  the  State  level,  disaster  management  cells operating  within  the  State  Administrative  Training  Institutes  (ATIs)  provide  the necessary training. Presently, 24 ATIs have dedicated faculties. There is a need for

strengthening  specialised  training,  including  training  of  personnel  in  disaster response.

- (d)  Capacity  building  should  not  be  limited  to  professionals  and  personnel involved in disaster management but should also focus on building the knowledge, attitude and  skills of a community  to  cope  with  the  effects of disasters. Identification and  training of volunteers  from  the  community  towards  first response  measures  as  well  as  mitigation  measures  is  an  urgent  imperative.  A programme of periodic drills should be introduced in vulnerable areas to enable prompt and appropriate community response in the event of a disaster, which can help save valuable lives.
- 39. Capacity building for effective disaster management therefore needs to be grounded and linked to the community and local level responders on the one hand and also to the institutional mechanism of the State and the Nation on the other.

## Community Level Initiatives

- 40. The  goal  of  any  disaster  management  initiative  is  to  build  a  disaster resistant/resilient community equipped with safer living and sustainable livelihoods to serve its own development purposes. The community is also the first responder in any disaster situation, thereby emphasising the need for community level initiatives in managing disasters. To encourage such initiatives, the following are required:
- (a)  Creating  awareness  through  disaster  education  and  training  and  information dissemination  are  necessary  steps  for  empowering  the  community  to  cope  with disasters.
- (b) Community based approach followed by most NGOs and Community Based Organisations (CBOs) should be incorporated in the disaster management system as an effective vehicle of community participation.

- (c)  Within  a  vulnerable  community,  there  exist  groups  that  are  more  vulnerable like women and children, aged and infirm and physically challenged people who need  special  care  and  attention  especially  during  disaster  situations.  Efforts  are required for identifying such vulnerable groups and providing special assistance in terms of evacuation, relief, aid and medical attention to them in disaster situations.
- 41. Management  of  disasters  should  therefore  be  an  interface  between  a community  effort  to  mitigate  and  prevent  disasters  as  also  an  effort  from  the government machinery to buttress and support popular initiatives.

## Strengthening of Plan Activities

- 42. Given the pervasive nature of disasters and the widespread havoc caused by  some  of  them,  planned  expenditure  on  disaster  mitigation  and  prevention measures in addition to the CRF is required. The Central Sector Scheme of Natural Disaster  Management  Programmes  has  been  implemented  since  1993-94  by  the Department  of  Agriculture  and  Co-operation  with  the  objective  to  focus  on disaster preparedness with emphasis on mitigation and preparedness measures for enhanced capability to reduce the adverse impact of disasters. The major activities undertaken within this  scheme include the setting  up of  the  National  Centre  for Disaster  Management  (NCDM)  at  the  Indian  Institute  of  Public  Administration, creation of 24 disaster management faculties in 23 states, research and consultancy services, documentation of major disaster events and forging regional cooperation. The Eighth Plan allocation of Rs 6.30 crore for this scheme was increased to Rs. 16.32 crore in the Ninth Plan. Within this scheme, NCDM has conducted over 50 training programmes,  training more  than 1000  people, while 24 disaster management  centres  with  dedicated  faculty  have  been  established  in  the  states. Over 4000 people have been trained at the State level. In addition, some important publications and audio-visual training modules have been prepared and documentation of disaster events has been done.

- 43. Though limited in scope and outlays, the Scheme has made an impact on the training and research activities in the country. Creation of faculties in disaster management  in  all  28  states  is  proposed  to  be  taken  up  in  the  Tenth  Plan  in addition to community mobilisation, human resource development, establishment of Control Rooms and forging international cooperation in disaster management. There is also an urgent need for strengthening the disaster management pedagogy by  creating  disaster  management  faculties  in  universities,  rural  development institutes and other organisations of premier research.
- 44. Sustainability  is  the  key  word  in  the  development  process.  Development activities that do not consider the disaster loss perspective fail to be sustainable. The compounded costs of disasters relating to loss of life, loss of assets, economic activities, and cost of reconstruction of not only assets but of lives can scarcely be borne  by  any  community  or  nation.  Therefore,  all  development  schemes  in vulnerable  areas  should  include  a  disaster  mitigation  analysis,  whereby  the feasibility of a project is assessed with respect to vulnerability of the area and the mitigation measures required for sustainability. Environmental protection, afforestation  programmes,  pollution  control,  construction  of  earthquake  resistant structures etc., should therefore have high priority within the plans.
- 45. The aim of a mitigation strategy is to reduce losses in the event of a future occurrence  of  a  hazard.  Structural  mitigation  may  comprise  construction  of individual disaster resistant structures like retrofitted or earthquake-resistant buildings or creation of structures whose function is primarily disaster protection like flood control structures, dykes, levees, infiltration dams etc.
- 46. Mitigation  measures  on  individual  structures  can  be  achieved  by  design standards, building codes and performance specifications. Building codes, critical front-line defence for achieving  stronger engineered structures, need to be drawn

up  in  accordance  with  the  vulnerability  of  the  area  and  implemented  through appropriate techno-legal measures.

- 47. Mitigation measures need to be considered in land use and site planning activities.  Constructions in hazardous areas like flood plains or steep soft slopes are more vulnerable to disasters. Necessary mitigation measures need to be built into the design and costing of development projects.
- 48. Insurance  is  a  potentially  important  mitigation  measure  in  disaster-prone areas  as  it  brings  quality  in  the  infrastructure  &amp;  consciousness  and  a  culture  of safety  by  its  insistence  on  following  building  codes,  norms,  guidelines,  quality materials in construction etc. Disaster insurance mostly works under the premise of 'higher the risk higher the premium, lesser the risk lesser the premium', thus creating  awareness  towards  vulnerable  areas  and  motivating  people  to  settle  in relatively safer areas.

## THE PATH AHEAD

- 49. For addressing natural calamities such as floods and drought, there already exist a number of plan schemes under which a lot is being done and can be done. State Governments need to make full use of the existing plan schemes and give priority  to  implementation  of  such  schemes  that  will  help  in  overcoming  the conditions created by the calamity. In some cases this implies possible diversion of  the  funds  from  other  schemes  to  those  schemes  the  implementation  of  which will  help  meeting  the  situation.  There  may  also  be  need  in  a  crisis  situation  for certain re-appropriations/reallocations among the different departments.
- 50. The Planning Commission will aim at responding quickly to the needs of the  Central  Ministries/Departments/States  in  matters  relating  to  the  Plan  for meeting  situations  arising  out  of  natural  disasters,  by  enabling  adjustment  of schemes to meet the requirements as far as possible. A mechanism will be evolved

to  take  expeditious  decisions  on  proposals  which  involve  transfer  of  funds  from one  scheme  to  another,  or  any  other  change  which  involves  departure  from  the existing schemes/ pattern of assistance, new schemes and relaxation in procedures, etc. in the case of natural disasters.

- 51. As the first responder in any disaster situation, however, each State needs to  build  a  team  ,  skilled  personnel,  make  provision  for  specialised  equipments, efficient  communication  network,  and  relevant,  intelligent  and  easily  accessible database. There is also a need to consider creation of a plan scheme in each state basically  to  meet  the  minimum  requirements  for  strengthening  communications and  emergency  control  rooms,  thereby  improving  coordination  and  response  to disasters. No new institutional structures need be created in such a scheme.
- 52. In particular, with regard to major disasters, it is also necessary for disaster mitigation components to be built into all development projects. In order to save larger  outlays  on  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  subsequently,  a  mechanism would  need  to  be  worked  out  for  allowing  components  that  specifically  help projects coming up in highly disaster prone areas withstand the impact of natural disasters as part of approved project cost for projects financed under the Plan.
- 53. The  message  for  the  Tenth  Plan  is  that  in  order  to  move  towards  safer national development, development projects should be sensitive towards disaster mitigation. With the kind of economic losses and developmental setbacks that the country has been suffering year after year, it makes good economic sense to spend a  little  extra  today  in  a  planned  way  on  steps  and  components  that  can  help  in prevention  and  mitigation  of  disasters,  than  be  forced  to  spend  many  multiples more later on restoration and rehabilitation. The design of development projects and the process of development should take the aspect of disaster reduction and mitigation  within  its  ambit;  otherwise,  the  development  ceases  to  be  sustainable and eventually causes more hardship and loss to the nation.

## GUIDELINES TO STATE GOVERNMENTS

- (i) The State Department of Relief and Rehabilitation may be converted into Department of Disaster Management with the responsibility of looking at the whole cycle of disaster managementprevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, relief and rehabilitation. Steps for prevention/mitigation will need to be taken across a number of Departments.  The Department of Disaster Management will coordinate the steps taken by the different Department of the Government in these spheres.
- (ii) Mitigation,  preparedness  and  response  are  multi-disciplinary  activities involving a number  of  Departments.  In order to ensure the fullest involvement  of  the  relevant  Departments,  the  State  Government  may consider  setting  up  a  State  Disaster  Management  Authority  under  the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary  with the Secretaries of Departments of Water  Resources,  Health,  Agriculture, Animal  Husbandry,  Roads, Communications, Rural Development, Public Works, Public Health Engineering,  Finance  and  Home  as  Members.    The  Secretary  of  the Department of Disaster Management may be the member-Secretary.  This authority will ensure coordinated steps towards mitigation and preparedness as also coordinated response when a disaster strikes.
- (iii) It  has  been  noticed  that  while  the  local  administration  has  the  requisite skills and capabilities for carrying out search and rescue in recurrent types of disaster like flood, there is lack of capability for  specialised search and rescue.  Each State may consider setting up specialised search and rescue teams.    The teams would need to be composite with one coy of the State Armed  Police  trained  and  equipped  to  carry  out  specialised  search  and rescue;  one  mobile  engineering  unit  with  necessary  equipment  and  one medical  assistance  team.    These  teams  may  be  constituted  and  trained

together so as to function as a unit under the overall charge of a designated officer.  Guidance/advise required with reference to training and equipment will be provided by the Disaster Management Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.

- (iv) It  has  been  decided  that  fire  services  may  be  trained  and  equipped  to function  as  all  hazard  response  units  as  in  other  countries.    This  will necessitate  some  additional  equipment  and  training  to  the  fire  units  for carrying our search and rescue in all types of disasters. The Government of India will be initiating a separate project for this.
- (v) The  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  had  advised  the  State  Governments  that composite control rooms may be set up at the State level and at the district levels under the District Magistrates for coordinating law and order as well as  disaster  management  and  that  allocations  under  the  Modernisation  of Police  Forces  Schemes  may  be  used  for  the  this  purpose.    Steps  may  be taken to put such control room in place quickly with standby communication systems.
- (vi) Disaster  mitigation  concerns/  aspects  may  be  made  an  essential  term  of reference for every plan project/development scheme in the areas vulnerable to disasters.  In other words, every plan project will need to state as  to  how  is  addresses  mitigation  concerns.    Plans/projects  specifically addressing mitigation/ prevention may be given a priority. The Secretary of Department of Disaster Management may be made a member for all bodies/ teams constituted for scrutinizing/approving projects/plans.
- (vii) Funds  available  under  the  ongoing  schemes  may  be  used  for  mitigation/ preparedness. For example funds under the rural development scheme can be  used  for  construction  of  cycle  shelters  in  areas  prone  to  cyclones. Similarly,  sites  and  designs  of  primary  school  buildings  in  flood  prone areas  may  be  so  selected  so  that  they  can  serve  as  shelters  in  times  of floods.  The design requirements for primary school building and hospitals

and other important public buildings in seismic zones V and IV would need to be in accordance with BIS norms for construction in these zones.

- (viii) Every  hazard  prone  district  may  draw  up  specific  hazard  related  plans. These plans may be reviewed/updated in the months of April and May each year.
- (ix) Every district located in area prone to hazard will need to maintain an on line inventory of resources available in the Government, public and private sector.  This will enable easy and quick mobilization of resources in case of need. A  State-wide on line resources inventory would  enable the mobilization of resources from neighbouring districts in cases of need.
- (x) State in seismic zone V and IV may ensure that the BIS building codes for these zones  have  been  adopted  and  are rigorously enforced by the municipal bodies.  All construction in the Government sector in these areas must conform to the BIS code.
- (xi) The  initial  training  curriculum  of  the  field  staff-  VLWs,  Karamcharis, Patwaris,  Talhatis,  Block  Agriculture  Officers,  Block  Animal  Husbandry Officers other Block Supervisors, State Civil Service Officers, Constables, Sub-inspectors, Dy S.Ps etc. in the States vulnerable to hazards may include capsules on basic dos and don'ts in case of disasters; disaster mitigation and response,  search  and  rescues  techniques  etc.    In-service  training  may  be organized for staff already in service.
- (xii) Special  efforts  may  be  put  in  for  education  and  awareness.    This  should include  awareness  of  basic  design  requirements  for  constructing  private housing  in  seismic  zones  IV  and  V  as  well  as  in  the  belt  vulnerable  to cyclones.
- (xiii) AICTE  have  been  advised  to  include  engineering  aspects  of  disaster mitigation  in  the  engineering  courses  at  the  undergraduate  level.    State Governments  may  take  similar action with reference to engineering colleges under their universities.

- (xiv) CBSE have been advised to include basic disaster related material in text books for classes 8 th , 9 th and 10 th - the basic dos and don'ts / precaution to be  taken  etc.    State  Government  may  advise  their  Secondary  Boards  of Education to include similar in their text  books.

## SECTION -I

## Introduction

- 1.1 India has been  traditionally vulnerable  to natural disasters on account of its unique geo-climatic conditions.  Floods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes  and landslides    have  been  a  recurrent    phenomena.    About  60%  of  the  landmass  is prone to earthquakes of various intensities; over 40 million hectares  is prone  to floods; about 8% of the total area is prone  to cyclones and  68% of the area  is susceptible  to  drought.      In  the  decade    1990-2000,  an  average    of  about  4344 people  lost their lives and about 30 million people were  affected  by disasters every year.  The loss in terms of  private, community and public  assets  has been astronomical.
- 1.2 At  the  global    level,  there  has  been  considerable    concern  over    natural disasters.  Even  as substantial scientific and material progress is made,  the loss of lives and property due to disasters  has not  decreased.  In fact,  the human toll and economic    losses    have  mounted.    It  was    in  this  background  that  the  United Nations  General  Assembly,  in  1989,      declared    the  decade  1990-2000  as  the International Decade  for Natural Disaster Reduction with the objective  to reduce loss  of lives and property  and restrict socio-economic damage  through concerted international  action, specially in developing countries.
- 1.3 The super cyclone in Orissa  in  October, 1999 and the  Bhuj earthquake in Gujarat  in    January,  2001  underscored  the  need  to  adopt  a  multi  dimensional endeavour  involving diverse scientific, engineering, financial and social processes; the need to adopt multi  disciplinary and multi sectoral  approach and incorporation  of risk reduction in the developmental plans and strategies.

- 1.4. Over the past couple of years, the Government of India have brought about a  paradigm  shift  in  the  approach  to  disaster  management.    The  new  approach proceeds  from  the  conviction  that  development  cannot  be  sustainable  unless disaster mitigation is built into the development process.  Another corner stone of the  approach  is  that  mitigation  has  to  be  multi-disciplinary  spanning  across  all sectors  of  development.    The  new  policy  also  emanates  from  the  belief  that investments in mitigation are much more cost effective than expenditure on relief and rehabilitation.
- 1.5 Disaster management occupies an important place in this country's policy framework as it is the  poor  and  the  under-privileged  who  are  worst  affected  on account of calamities/disasters.
- 1.6 The  steps  being  taken  by  the  Government  emanate  from  the  approach outlined  above.    The  approach  has  been  translated  into  a  National  Disaster Framework  [a  roadmap]  covering  institutional  mechanisms,  disaster  prevention strategy, early warning system, disaster mitigation, preparedness and response and human  resource  development.    The  expected  inputs,  areas  of  intervention  and agencies  to  be  involved  at  the  National,  State  and  district  levels  have  been identified and listed in the roadmap.  This roadmap has been shared with all the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations. Ministries and Departments of Government of India, and the State Governments/UT Administrations have been advised to develop their respective roadmaps taking the national  roadmap  as  a  broad  guideline.    There  is,  therefore,  now  a  common strategy underpinning the action being taken by all the participating organisations/stakeholders.  A copy of the roadmap is at Annexure - I.

## SECTION-II

## Institutional and Policy Framework

- 2.1 The  institutional  and  policy  mechanisms  for  carrying  out  response,  relief and rehabilitation have been well-established since Independence. These mechanisms have proved to be robust and effective insofar as response, relief and rehabilitation are concerned.
- 2.2 At the national level, the Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal Ministry for all  matters  concerning disaster management.   The Central Relief Commissioner (CRC) in the Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal officer  to  coordinate  relief operations for natural disasters. The  CRC  receives  information  relating to forecasting/warning of a natural calamity from India Meteorological Department (IMD) or from Central Water Commission of Ministry of Water Resources on a continuing  basis.  The  Ministries/Departments/Organizations  concerned  with  the primary and secondary functions relating to the management of disasters include: India Meteorological Department, Central Water Commission, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Urban Development, Department of Communications, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Petroleum, Department  of  Agriculture  &amp;  Cooperation.  Ministry  of  Power,  Department  of Civil Supplies, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Planning  Commission,  Cabinet  Secretariat,  Department  of  Surface  Transport, Ministry  of  Social  Justice,  Department  of  Women  and  Child  Development, Ministry of Environment and Forest, Department of Food. Each Ministry/Department/Organization  nominate  their  nodal  officer  to  the  Crisis Management Group chaired by Central Relief Commissioner. The nodal officer is

responsible for preparing sectoral Action Plan/Emergency Support Function Plan for managing disasters.

- 2.3 National  Crisis  Management  Committee  (NCMC): Cabinet  Secretary, who  is  the  highest  executive  officer,  heads  the  NCMC.  Secretaries  of  all  the concerned Ministries  /Departments  as  well  as  organizations  are  the  members  of the Committee   The NCMC gives direction to the Crisis Management Group as deemed  necessary.  The  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  is  responsible  for ensuring that all developments are brought to the notice of the NCMC promptly. The  NCMC  can  give  directions  to    any  Ministry/Department/Organization  for specific action needed for meeting the crisis situation.
- 2.4 Crisis  Management  Group : The  Central  Relief  Commissioner  in  the Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  is  the  Chairman  of  the  CMG,  consisting  of  senior officers  (called  nodal  officers)  from  various  concerned  Ministries.  The  CMG's functions  are  to  review  every  year  contingency  plans  formulated  by  various Ministries/Departments/Organizations in their respective sectors, measures required for dealing with a natural disasters, coordinate the activities of the Central Ministries  and  the  State  Governments  in  relation  to  disaster  preparedness  and relief  and  to  obtain  information  from  the  nodal  officers  on  measures  relating  to above. The CMG, in the event of a natural disaster, meets frequently to review the relief operations and extend all possible assistance required by the affected States to overcome the situation effectively. The Resident Commissioner of the affected State is also associated with such meetings.
- 2.5 Control Room (Emergency Operation Room): An Emergency Operations Center (Control Room) exists in the nodal Ministry of Home Affairs, which functions round the clock, to assist the Central Relief Commissioner in the discharge of his duties. The activities of the Control Room include collection and

transmission of information concerning natural calamity and relief, keeping close contact  with  governments  of  the  affected  States,  interaction  with  other  Central Ministries/Departments/Organizations in connection with relief, maintaining records  containing  all  relevant  information  relating  to  action  points  and  contact points  in  Central  Ministries  etc.,  keeping  up-to-date  details  of  all  concerned officers at the Central and State levels.

- 2.6 Contingency Action Plan: A  National  Contingency  Action  Plan  (CAP) for  dealing  with  contingencies  arising  in  the  wake  of  natural  disasters  has  been formulated by the Government of India and it had been periodically updated.   It facilitates the launching of relief operations without delay.   The CAP identifies the  initiatives  required  to  be  taken  by  various  Central  Ministries/Departments  in the wake of natural calamities, sets down the procedure and determines the focal points in the administrative machinery.
- 2.7 State  Relief  Manuals: Each  State  Government  has  relief  manuals/codes which  identify  that  role  of  each  officer  in  the  State  for  managing  the  natural disasters. These are reviewed and updated periodically based on the experience of managing the disasters and the need of the State.
- 2.8 Funding mechanisms: The  policy  and  the  funding  mechanism  for provision of relief assistance to those affected by natural calamities is clearly laid down.    These  are  reviewed  by  the  Finance  Commission  appointed  by  the Government  of  India every five years. The  Finance Commission  makes recommendation regarding the division of tax and non-tax revenues between the Central  and  the  State  Governments  and  also  regarding  policy  for  provision  of relief assistance and their share of expenditure thereon.  A Calamity Relief Fund (CRF) has been set up in each State as per the recommendations of the Eleventh Finance Commission.  The size of the Calamity Relief Fund has been fixed by the

Finance  Commission  after  taking  into  account  the  expenditure  on  relief  and rehabilitation over the past 10 years.  The Government of India contributes 75% of the corpus of the Calamity Relief Fund in each State.  25% is contributed to by the State.  Relief assistance to those affected by natural calamities is granted from the CRF.  Overall norms for relief assistance are laid down by a national committee with  representatives  of  States  as  members.    Different  States  can  have  Statespecific  norms  to  be  recommended  by  State  level  committee  under  the  Chief Secretary.  Where the calamity is of such proportion that the funds available in the CRF will not be sufficient for provision of relief, the State seeks assistance from the National  Calamity  Contingency  Fund  (NCCF) -  a  fund  created  at  the Central Government level.  When such requests are received, the requirements are assessed  by  a  team  from  the  Central  Governemnt  and  thereafter  the  assessed requirements are cleared by a High Level Committee chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister.  In brief, the institutional arrangements for response and relief are wellestablished and have proved to be robust and effective.

2.9 In  the  federal  set  up  of  India,  the  basic  responsibility  for  undertaking rescue, relief and rehabilitation measures in the event of a disaster is that of the State Governemnt concerned.  At the State level, response, relief and rehabilitation are handled  by  Departments  of  Relief  &amp;  Rehabilitation.    The  State  Crisis Management Committee set up under the Chairmanship of Chief Secretary who is the highest executive functionary in the State.  All the concerned Departments and organisations  of  the  State  and  Central  Government  Departments  located  in  the State are represented in this Committee.  This Committee reviews the action taken for  response  and  relief  and  gives  guidelines/directions  as  necessary.    A  control room  is  established  under  the  Relief  Commissioner.    The  control  room  is  in constant touch with the climate monitoring/forecasting agencies and monitors the action being taken by various agencies in performing their responsibilities.  The district  level  is  the  key  level  for  disaster  management  and  relief  activities.    The

Collector/Dy.  Commissioner is the chief  administrator  in  the  district.    He  is  the focal  point  in  the  preparation  of  district  plans  and  in  directing,  supervising  and monitoring    calamities  for  relief.    A  District  Level  Coordination  and  Relief Committee  is  constituted  and  is  headed  by  the  Collector  as  Chairman  with participation of all other related government and non governmental agencies and departments in addition to the elected representatives. The Collector is required to maintain close liaison with the  district and the State Governments as well as the nearest  units  of  Armed  Forces/Central  police  organisations  and  other  relevant Central  Government  organisations  like  Ministries  of  Communications,  Water Resources, Drinking Water, Surface Transport, who could supplement the efforts of the district administration in the rescue and relief operations.  The efforts of the Government  and  non-governmental  organisations  for  response  and  relief  and coordinated by the Collector/Dy. Commissioner. The District Magistrate/Collector and Coordination Committee under him reviews preparedness measures prior to a impending hazard and coordinate response when the hazard strikes.   As all the Departments of the State Government and district level report to the Collector, there is an effective coordination mechanism ensuring holistic response.

- 2.10 New institutional mechanisms: As has been made  clear above, the existing mechanisms had based on post-disaster relief and rehabilitation and they have proved to be robust and effective mechanisms in addressing these requirements.  The changed policy/approach, however, mandates a priority to full disaster aspects of mitigation, prevention and preparedness and new institutional and policy mechanisms are being put in place to address the policy change.
- 2.11 It is proposed to constitute a National Emergency Management Authority at the National level. The High Powered Committee on Disaster Management which was set up in August, 1999 and submitted its Report in October,  2001, had inter

alia recommended that a separate Department of Disaster Management be set up in the Government of India. It was, however, felt that conventional Ministries/Departments have the drawback of not being flexible enough specially in terms of the sanction procedures. The organisation at the Apex level will have to  be  multi-disciplinary  with  experts  covering  a  large  number  of  branches.  The National  Emergency  Management  Authority  has,  therefore,  been  proposed  as  a combined Secretariat/Directorate structure - a structure which will be an integral part  of  the  Government  and,  therefore,  will  work  with  the  full  authority  of  the Government  while, at the same time, retaining the flexibility of a field organisation. The National Emergency Management Authority will be headed by an  officer  of  the  rank  of  Secretary/Special  Secretary  to  the  Government  in  the Ministry of Home Affairs with Special Secretaries/Additional Secretaries from the Ministries/Departments  of  Health,  Water  Resources,  Environment  &amp;  Forests, Agriculture, Railways, Atomic Energy, Defence, Chemicals, Science &amp; Technology,  Telecommunications,  Urban  Employment  and  Poverty  Alleviation, Rural  Development  and  India  Meteorological  Department  as  Members  of  the Authority. The Authority would meet as often as required and review the status of warning systems, mitigation measures and disaster preparedness. When a disaster strikes, the Authority will coordinate disaster management  activities. The Authority will be responsible for:-

- i) Coordinating/mandating Government's policies for disaster reduction/mitigation.
- ii) Ensuring adequate preparedness at all levels   in order to meet disasters.
- iii) Coordinating response to a disaster when it strikes.
- iv) Coordination of post disaster relief and rehabilitation.

The  National  Emergency  Management  Authority  will  have  a  core  permanent secretariat  with  three  divisions  -  one  for  Disaster  Prevention,  Mitigation  &amp;

Rehabilitation,  the  other  for  Preparedness  and  the  third  for  Human  Resource Development.

2.12 At  the  State  level,  as  indicated  in  para  disaster  management  was  being handled by the Departments of Relief &amp; Rehabilitation.  As the name suggests, the focus  was  almost  entirely  on  post-calamity  relief.    The  Government  of  India  is working  with  the  State  Governments  to  convert  the  Departments  of  Relief  &amp; Rehabilitation into Departments of Disaster Management with an enhanced area of responsibility  to  include  mitigation  and  preparedness  apart  from  their  present responsibilities of relief and rehabilitation.  The changeover has already happened in eight State Governments/Union Territory Administrations.  The change is under process in other States.

2.13 The States have also been asked to set up Disaster Management Authorities under the Chief Minister with Ministers of relevant Departments [Water Resources,  Agriculture,  Drinking  Water  Supply,  Environment  &amp;  Forests,  Urban Development, Home, Rural Development etc.] as members.     The objective of setting up an Authority is to ensure that mitigation and preparedness is seen as the joint  responsibility  of  all  the  Departments  concerned    and  disaster  management concerns  are  mainstreamed  into  their  programmes.    This  holistic  and  multidisciplinary approach is the key to effective mitigation.

2.14. At  the  district  level,  the  District  Magistrate  who  is  the  chief  coordinator will  be  the  focal  point  for  coordinating  all  activities  relating  to  prevention, mitigation and preparedness apart from his existing responsibilities pertaining to response and relief.  The District Coordination and Relief Committee is being reconstituted/re-designated  into  Disaster  Management  Committees  with  officers from  relevant  departments  being  added  as  members.    Because  of  its  enhanced mandate of mitigation and prevention, the district heads and departments engaged

in  development  will  now  be  added  to  the  Committee  so  that  mitigation  and prevention is mainstreamed into the district plan.  The existing system of drawing up preparedness and response plans will continue.  There will, however, also be a long  term  mitigation  plan.    District  Disaster  Management  Committees  have already  been  constituted  in  several  districts  and  are  in  the  process  of  being constituted in the remaining multi-hazard prone districts.

2.15 Similarly, we are in the process of creating Block/Taluq Disaster Management Committees in these 169 multi-hazard prone districts in 17 States. At  the  village  level,  in  169  multi-hazard  prone  districts,  we  are  constituting Disaster Management Committees and Disaster Management Teams.  Each village will  have  a  Disaster  Management  Plan.    The  process  of  drafting  the  plan  has already begun.  The Disaster Management Committee which draws up the plans consists of elected representatives at the village level, local authorities, Government functionaries including doctors/paramedics of primary health centres located  in  the  village,  primary  school  teachers  etc.    The  plan  encompasses prevention,  mitigation  and  preparedness  measures.    The  Disaster  Management Teams at the village level will consist of members of voluntary organisations like Nehru Yuvak Kendra and other non-governmental organisations as well as able bodied  volunteers  from  the  village.    The  teams  are  provided  basic  training  in evacuation,  search  and  rescue  etc.    The  Disaster  Management  Committee  will review  the  disaster  management  plan  at  least  once  in  a  year.    It  would  also generate  awareness  among  the  people  in  the  village  about  dos'  and  don'ts  for specific hazards depending on the vulnerability of the village.  A large number of village level Disaster Management Committees and Disaster Management Teams have already been constituted.

2.16 The States have been advised to enact Disaster Management Acts.  These Acts provide for adequate powers for authorities coordinating mitigation,

preparedness and response as well as for mitigation/prevention measures required to be undertaken.  Two States [Gujarat &amp; Madhya Pradesh] have already enacted such a law.  Other States are in the process.  The State Governments have also been advised to convert their Relief Codes into Disaster Management Codes by including aspects  of prevention, mitigation and preparedness.

- 2.17 In  order  to  further  institutionalize  the  new  approach,  the  Government  of India have decided to enunciate a National Policy on Disaster Management.   A draft  policy  has  accordingly  been  formulated  and  is  expected  to  be  put  in  place shortly.  The  policy  shall  inform  all  spheres  of  Central  Government  activity  and shall  take  precedence over all existing sectoral policies. The broad objectives of the  policy  are  to  minimize  the  loss  of  lives  and  social,  private  and  community assets  because  of  natural  or  manmade  disasters  and  contribute  to  sustainable development and better standards of living for all, more specifically for the poor and  vulnerable  sections  by  ensuring  that  the  development  gains  are  not  lost through natural calamities/disasters.
- 2.18 The  policy  notes  that    State  Governments  are  primarily  responsible  for disaster management including prevention and mitigation, while the Government of India provides assistance where necessary as per the norms laid down from time to time and proposes that this overall framework may continue.  However, since response  to  a  disaster  requires  coordination  of  resources  available  across  all  the Departments of the Government, the policy mandates that the Central Government will,  in  conjunction  with  the  State  Governments,  seek  to  ensure  that  such  a coordination mechanism is laid down through an appropriate chain of command so that mobilization of resources is facilitated.
- 2.19 The broad features of the draft national policy on disaster management are enunciated below:-

- i) A  holistic  and  pro-active  approach  for  prevention,  mitigation  and preparedness will be adopted for disaster management.
- ii) Each  Ministry/Department  of  the  Central/State  Government  will  set apart  an  appropriate  quantum  of  funds  under  the  Plan  for  specific schemes/projects addressing vulnerability reduction and preparedness.
- iii) Where there is a shelf of projects, projects addressing mitigation will be given  priority.  Mitigation  measures  shall  be  built  into  the  on-going schemes/programmes
- iv) Each project in a hazard prone area will have mitigation as an essential term of reference. The project report will include a statement as to how the project addresses vulnerability reduction.
- v) Community involvement and awareness generation, particularly that of the vulnerable segments of population and women has been emphasized as  necessary    for  sustainable  disaster  risk  reduction.  This  is  a  critical component of the policy since communities are the first responders to disasters and, therefore, unless they are empowered and made capable of  managing  disasters,  any  amount  of  external  support  cannot  lead  to optimal results.
- vi) There will be close interaction with the corporate sector, nongovernmental  organisations  and  the  media  in  the  national  efforts  for disaster prevention/vulnerability reduction.
- vii) Institutional  structures/appropriate  chain  of  command  will  be  built  up and appropriate training imparted to disaster managers at various levels to ensure coordinated and quick response at all levels; and development of inter-State arrangements for sharing of resources during emergencies.
- viii) A culture of planning and preparedness is to be inculcated at all levels for capacity building measures.

- ix) Standard operating procedures and disaster management plans at state and district levels as well as by relevant central government departments for handling specific disasters will be laid down.
- x) Construction designs must correspond to the requirements as laid down in relevant Indian Standards.
- xi) All lifeline buildings in seismic zones III, IV &amp; V - hospitals, railway stations, airports/airport control towers, fire station buildings, bus stands major administrative centres will need to be evaluated and, if necessary, retro-fitted.
- xii) The existing relief codes in the States will be revised to develop them into disaster management  codes/manuals for institutionalizing the planning process with particular attention to mitigation and preparedness.
- 2.19 With the above mentioned institutional mechanism and policy framework in position and the actions taken to implement the policy guidelines, it is expected that the task of moving towards vulnerability reduction will be greatly facilitated.

## SECTION III

## Early Warning System

## Cyclone Forecasting

- 3.1 Tropical Cyclones  are  intense low pressure systems  which develop over warm sea.  They are capable  of causing  immense  damage   due to  strong winds, heavy rains and  storm surges.  The  frequency  of the TC  in the  Bay of Bengal is 4 to 5  times more than  in the Arabian Sea.  About  35%  of initial disturbances in the  north Indian ocean reach TC stage of which  45% become severe.
- 3.2 Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) is mandated to monitor and give warnings  regarding  Tropical Cyclone  (TC). Monitoring  process  has been revolutionized  by  the    advent  of  remote  sensing  techniques.    A  TC  intensity analysis    and  forecast  scheme    has  been    worked  out  using    satellite    image interpretation techniques which facilitate forecasting  of  storm surges.
- 3.3 Data resources are crucial to early forecasting of cyclones.  Satellite based observations    are  being    extensively  utilized.  Satellite    integrated  automated weather  stations    have    been    installed    on  islands,  oilrigs  and  exposed  coastal sites.  Buoys  for supplementing  the surface data  network  in the  tropical ocean have been deployed.  The Government have also started  a  National Data Buoy Programme.  A set of 12  moored  buoys have been deployed  in the northern Indian Ocean  to provide meteorological  and oceanographic data.
- 3.4 Dynamic forecasting of TCs requires knowledge of the vertical structure of both the Cyclone and the surrounding environment.  The  rawin sonde remains the principal  equipment  for  sounding.    The    Doppler  Radar  wind  profiler  provides hourly soundings.  A mesosphere, stratosphere, troposphere (MST) radar has also been  installed  at    Thirupatti.    Another  profiler  is  being  developed  and  will  be

deployed  at    IMD  Pune.    Another  important  source  of  upper  level  data  is  the aircraft reports.  Increasing number of commercial jet aircraft are equipped with the    Aircraft  Meteorological  Data    Relay  system.    This  data  is  being  made available  is also being  used by the  IMD for analysis and predictions.

- 3.5 Radars have been used  to  observe TCs since long.  Surveillance  of the spiral rain bands  and the eye of the TC is  an important function  of the coastal radars.  10 Cyclones Detection Radars have already been installed.  These radars are  providing  useful  estimates    of    storm  centres  upto    a  range    300-400  Km. Doppler  radars  provide    direct    measurements  of  wind  fields  in    TCs.    Due  to range limitation,  Doppler wind  estimates  are  usually within a  range of about 100  Km.    IMD    has  deployed      Doppler    radars  at    3  sites    on  the  east  coast. Another set of 3  Doppler radars are being deployed  in Andhra Pradesh in near future.
- 3.6 The  meteorological satellite has made a tremendous impact on the analysis of    cyclones.    All    developing  cloud  clusters  are  routinely  observed  through satellite  cloud  imagery    &amp;    those  showing  signs  of  organisation  are  closely monitored for  signs of intensification.  TC forecasters everywhere use the Dvorak technique to estimate  storm  location and intensity.  It has been found to provide realistic    estimates  for    TCs    in  the  Bay    of  Bengal  as  well  as  Arabian    Sea. INSAT   data has also been used to  study the structures of different  TCs in the Bay of Bengal.  IMD is also  producing  Cloud Motion  Vectors (CMVs).  Very High Resolution  Radiometer (VHRR) payload onboard INSAT -2E which have been improved upon to provide  water vapor channel data in addition to VIS &amp; IR onboard INSAT - 2E.  A separate  payload known as  Charged Couple Device (CCD) has also been deployed  onboard this  satellite.

- 3.7 The goal  of  any warning system is to maximize the number of people who take appropriate and timely action for the safety of life and property.  All  warning systems  start  with  detection  of  the  event  and  with  people  getting  out  of  harm's way.  Such warning systems encompass three equally important elements namely; Detection and  Warning; Communication;  and  Response.
- 3.8 The two stage warning system has been in existence since long in  IMD. Recently  it has been improved upon by introducing two more stages - the 'PreCyclone    watch'  and  the    'post-landfall    Scenario'.    This  four    stage  warning system meets the  requirements of  Public  Administrators    and  Crisis  Managers. The 'Pre-Cyclone Watch' stage, contains early  warning about the development of a  cyclonic disturbance in the form of monsoon depression which has a potential to threaten  the coast with cyclone force  winds.  The  coastal stretch likely to be affected is identified.  This early warning bulletin  is issued by the IMD before the Cyclone-Alert Stage.  This provides  enough lead time for the crisis  managers to undertake preparedness actions.
- 3.9 After  the  early  warning  on  the  'Pre-Cyclone  Watch'  the  Collectors    of coastal  and  few  immediate    interior  districts  and  the  Chief  Secretary  of  the concerned maritime  State are  warned  in two stages,  whenever any coastal belt is expected    to experience  adverse    weather  (heavy  rain/gales/tidal  wave)  in association  with  a    cyclonic  storm    or  a  depression  likely    to  intensify  into  a cyclonic storm.
- 3.10 The second stage of 'Cyclone Alert' is sounded  48 hours  in advance  of the  expected    commencement    of  adverse  weather    over  the  coastal  areas. Forecasts  of    commencement    of  strong    winds,  heavy    precipitation  along    the coast in association with arrival of cyclone are issued at the alert stage.  Landfall point  is usually not  identified  at this stage.  The  third stage warning known as

'Cyclone  Warning' is  issued 24 hours in advance.  Landfall point is  forecast in this  stage of cyclone  warning.  In  addition to the forecasts for heavy rains and strong winds, the storm surge forecast is also issued.  Since  the storm surge is the biggest  killer  so  far    as  the  devastating  attributes  of  a  storm  are  concerned, information  in  this  regard  is  most  critical  for  taking  follow  up  action  for evacuation from the low  lying areas likely to be affected  by the storm.

- 3.11 After  the landfall  of the cyclone the strong winds  with gale force speeds continue over  certain interior districts of the maritime  States hit  by  the cyclone. To  take    cognizance    of  that,    a  fourth  stage  known  as  'Post-landfall  Scenario Stage' is now identified usually as a part  of the 'Cyclone Warning Stage' either at the time of  landfall of the disturbance or about   twelve hour in advance of it.  It includes warnings of strong winds  and heavy rains likely to be encountered in the interior districts.
- 3.12 For communications,  the IMD makes  use of  97 point-to-point  teleprinter links    connecting    different    field  offices.    Switching  computers  have  been provided  at 5  Regional Centres.  These  computers are  linked  to  the central Regional  Telecom  Hub  Computer  at  New  Delhi.    In  addition,  69    centres  have been provided  with 85  telex connections.  Besides,  27 field offices have been provided  with  Radio  Teletype  facility.  IMD also utilizes  VSAT technology which has been  installed at  field  offices.  In addition,  there are a number of HF/RT and VHF links.
- 3.13 Cyclone    warnings  are  communicated    to    Crisis      Managers    and  other concerned organizations by high priority telegrams, telex, telephones and Police wireless.    Cyclone  warning  are  provided  by  the  IMD  from  the  Area  Cyclone Warning  Centres  (ACWCs)  at  Calcutta,  Chennai  and  Mumbai  and  Cyclone Warning  Centers  (CWCs)  at  Vishakhapatnam,  Bhubaneswar  and  Ahmedabad.

There is also a  Satellite based communication system called the Cyclone Warning Dissemination Systems (CWDS) for transmission of warnings. There are 250 such cyclone-warning sets installed  in  the  cylone  prone  areas  of  east  and  west  coast. The  general public, the coastal residents and fishermen, are also  warned through the Government  mechinery  and  broadcast    of  warnings  through  AIR  and Television.

## Flood Forecasting

- 3.17 Flooding is caused by the inadequate capacity within the banks of the rivers to  contain the high flow brought down from the upper catchments due to heavy rainfall.    It is also caused by accumulation of water resulting from heavy spells of rainfall over areas, which have got poor drainage characteristics.
- 3.18 Flooding is accentuated by erosion and silting leading to meandering of the rivers in plains and reduction in carrying capacity of the river channel.  It is also aggravated by earthquakes and land slides, leading to changes in river course and obstructions  to      flow.      Synchronization  of  floods  in  the  main  rivers      and tributaries    and  retardation  of  flow  due  to  tidal  effects  lead  to  major  floods. Cyclones bring in their wake considerable loss of life and property.
- 3.19 The  flood  forecasting  and  warning  system  is  used  for  alerting  the  likely damage centers well in advance of the actual arrival of floods, to enable the people to  move  and  also  to  remove  the  moveable  property  to  safer  places  or  to  raised platforms specially constructed for the purpose.
- 3.20 A beginning in scientific flood forecasting was made in November, 1958 by Central Water Commission (then known as Central Water &amp; Power Commission) when  a  Flood  Forecasting  Centre  was  set  up  at  its  Headquarters,  at  Delhi,  for

giving  timely  Forecasts  and  Warnings  of  the  incoming  floods  to  the  villages located  in  the  river  areas  around  the  National  Capital,  Delhi.    The  network  has been expanding and by now the Flood Forecasting Network of the Central Water Commission(CWC) covers all the major flood prone inter-State river basins in the country.

3.21 At present there are 166 flood forecasting stations on various rivers in the country which includes 134 level forecasting and 32 inflow forecasting stations, river-wise break up of which is as under :

| Sl.No.   | Name of River Systems     | No. of Flood Forecasting Stations   | No. of Flood Forecasting Stations   | No. of Flood Forecasting Stations   |

- 3.23 The Flood Forecasting involves the following four main activities :-
- (i) Observation  and  collection  of  hydrological  and  hydro-meteorological data;
- (ii) Transmission of Data to Forecasting Centres;
- (iii) Analysis of data and formulation of forecast; and
- (iv) Dissemination of forecast.

3.24 On an average, 6000 forecasts at various places in the country are issued during  the  monsoon  season  every  year.      The  analysis  of  the  forecasts  issued during  the  last  25  years  (1978  to  2002)  indicates  that  accuracy  of  forecasts  has consistently increased from around 81% to 98%.  Forecast is considered accurate if  forecast  water  level  is  within  ±  15  cm.  of  actual  water  level  of  the  inflow forecast (i.e. discharge) is with in ± 20% of actual discharge.

- 3.25 In monitoring the floods, severity of floods are placed in the following four categories by the central Water Commissions.

## (i) Low flood stage:

It is that flood situation when the water level of the river is flowing between warning level and danger level of the forecasting stations.

## (ii) Medium flood stage:

The river  is  called  in  medium  floods  when  its  water  level  is  at  or above the danger level of the forecasting station but below 0.50 of its highest flood level (HFL).

## (iii) High flood stage:

When the water level of the river is below the HFL but within 0.50 m. of the HFL of the forecasting stations.

## (iv) Unprecedented flood stage :

The  river  is  called  in  unprecedented  floods  when  it  attains  water level equal to or above its previous HFL at any forecasting station.

3.26 A computerized monitoring system has been developed under which daily water  levels  as  observed  at  0800  hrs.  and  forecasts  issued  by  field  units  are transmitted to CWC headquarters in New Delhi.   Based on the compilation of all such  data  received  from  field  divisions,  daily  water  level  and  flood  forecast bulletins in two parts for stage and for inflow forecasting stations respectively.

3.27 Special  Yellow  Bulletins  are  issued  whenever  the  river  stage  at  the forecasting site attains a level within 0.50 m of its previous HFL.  Red Bulletins highlighting security of the problem are also issued whenever the water level at the forecasting stations equals or exceeds previous HFL.

- 3.28 Bulletins are also updated on CWC Web site: www.cwc.nic.in wider publicity among user agencies during flood season.

## SECTION IV

## Disaster Prevention and Mitigation

- 4.1 The  Yokohama  message  emanating  from  the  international  decade  for natural disaster reduction in  May, 1994 underlined the need for an emphatic shift in  the  strategy  for  disaster  mitigation.    It  was  inter  alia  stressed  that  disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness and relief are  four elements which contribute to  and  gain,    from  the  implementation    of  the  sustainable  development  policies. These elements alongwith environmental protection and sustainable development, are  closely  inter  related.    Therefore,  nations    should    incorporate    them  in  their development plans and ensure efficient  follow up  measures at the community, sub-regional, regional, national and international levels.  The Yokohama Strategy also emphasized  that disaster  prevention, mitigation and preparedness  are better than  disaster  response  in  achieving    the  goals  and  objectives  of  vulnerability reduction.    Disaster  response  alone  is  not  sufficient  as  it  yields  only  temporary results  at  a  very  high  cost.    Prevention  and  mitigation  contribute  to  lasting improvement in safety and are essential to integrated disaster management.
- 4.2 The  Government  of  India  have  adopted  mitigation  and  prevention  as essential  components  of  their  development  strategy.    The  Tenth  Five  Year  Plan document  has  a  detailed  chapter  on  Disaster  Management.    A  copy  of  the  said chapter  is  enclosed  at Annexure  -  II. The  plan  emphasizes  the  fact  that development cannot be sustainable without mitigation being built into developmental    process.    Each  State  is  supposed  to  prepare  a  plan  scheme  for disaster mitigation in accordance with the approach outlined in the plan.  In brief, mitigation is being institutionalized into developmental planning.
- 4.3 As  indicated in the earlier chapter, the Finance  Commission  makes recommendations  with  regard to devolution of funds between  the Central

Government and State Governments as also outlays for relief and rehabilitation. The earlier Finance Commissions were mandated to look at relief and rehabilitation.  The Terms of Reference of the Twelfth Finance Commission have been  changed  and  the  Finance  Commission  has  been  mandated  to  look  at  the requirements  for  mitigation  and  prevention  apart  from  its  existing  mandate  of looking  at  relief  and  rehabilitation.    A  Memorandum  has  been  submitted  to  the Twelfth Finance Commission after consultation with States.  The Memorandum proposes a Mitigation Fund.

- 4.4 The Government of India have issued guidelines that where there is a shelf of projects, projects addressing mitigation will be given a priority.  It has also been mandated that each project in a hazard prone area will have disaster prevention/mitigation  as  a  term  of  reference  and  the  project  document  has  to reflect  as  to  how  the  project  addresses  that  term  of  reference.    A  copy  of  the guidelines is at Annexure - III.
- 4.5 Measures for flood mitigation were taken from 1950 onwards.  As against the total of 40 million hectares prone to floods, area of about 15 million hectares have  been  protected  by  construction  of  embankments.    A  number  of  dams  and barrages  have  been  constructed.    The  State  Governments  have  been  assisted  to take up mitigation programmes like construction of raised platforms etc.  Floods continue  to  be  a  menace  however  mainly  because  of  the  huge  quantum  of  silt being carried by the rivers emanating from the Himalayas.  This silt has raised the bed level in many rivers to above the level of the countryside.  Embankments have also  gives  rise  to  problems  of  drainage  with  heavy  rainfall  leading  to  water logging in areas outside the embankment.
- 4.6 Due  to  erratic  behaviour  of  monsoons,  both    low  and  medium  rain  fall regions, which constitute about 68%  of the total area, are vulnerable  to periodical

droughts.  Our experience has been that  almost  every third year is a drought year. However,  in  some  of  the  States,  there  may  be    successive    drought  years enhancing the  vulnerability  of the population  in these  areas.  Local communities have devised indigenous safety mechanisms  and  drought oriented farming methods in many parts of the country.  From the experience of managing the past droughts particularly the severe drought of 1987, a number of programmes have been launched by the Government to mitigate the impact of drought in the long run.  These programmes include Drought Prone Area Programme (DPAP), Desert Development  Programme  (DDP),  National  Watershed  Development  Project  for Rainfed  Areas  (NWDPRA),  Watershed  Development  Programme  for  Shifting Cultivation (WDPSC), Integrated Water Development Project (IWDP), Integrated Afforestation and Eco-development Project Scheme (IAEPS).

4.7 A comprehensive programme has been taken up for earthquake mitigation. Although,  the  BIS  has  laid  down  the  standards  for  construction  in  the  seismic zones,  these  were  not  being  followed.    The  building  construction  in  urban  and suburban areas is regulated by the Town and Country Planning Acts and Building Regulations.  In many cases, the Building regulations do not incorporate the BIS codes.    Even  where  they  do,  the  lack  of  knowledge  regarding  seismically  safe construction  among  the  architects  and  engineers  as  well  as  lack  of  awareness regarding their vulnerability among the population led to most of the construction in the urban/sub-urban areas being without reference to BIS standards.  In the rural areas,  the  bulk  of  the  housing  is  non-engineered  construction.    The  mode  of construction in the rural areas has also changed from mud and thatch to brick and concrete construction thereby increasing the vulnerability. The  increasing population has led to settlements in vulnerable areas close to the river bed areas which are prone to liquefaction.  The Government have moved to address these issues.

- 4.8 A National Core  Group for Earthquake  Mitigation has been constituted consisting  of  experts  in  earthquake  engineering  and  administrators.    The    Core Group  has been assigned  with the responsibility  of drawing up  a strategy and plan  of  action  for  mitigating  the  impact    of  earthquakes;  providing  advice  and guidance to the States on various aspects of earthquake mitigation; developing/organizing  the preparation of  handbooks/pamphlets/type designs for earthquake  resistant  construction; working out systems for assisting the States in the seismically vulnerable  zones to adopt/integrate  appropriate  Bureau of Indian Standards  codes  in  their  building  byelaws;  evolving  systems  for  training    of municipal  engineers  as  also  practicing    architects  and  engineers  in  the  private sector  in  the  salient  features    of  Bureau  of  Indian    Standards  codes    and  the amended byelaws; evolving a system  of certification of architects/engineers  for testing  their  knowledge    of  earthquake    resistant  construction;  evolving  systems for training of masons  and carry out intensive  awareness  generation  campaigns.
- 4.9 A  Committee  of  experts    has  been  constituted    to  review  the  building byelaws. The  State  Governments  have  been  advised  to  ensure    rigorous enforcement of existing bye laws.  A national programme  for  capacity building for  earthquake    mitigation  has  been  finalized    for  imparting  training    to    10000 engineers  in public and private  sectors.  Since earthquake engineering  is not a part    of  course  curriculum  in  engineering    colleges  at  undergraduate    level  at present , it is proposed  to select  3 to 4  leading engineering colleges in each  State and  train    the  faculty    members    of  the  civil  engineering    departments  in earthquake  engineering  at the Indian   Institutes of  Technology and  few other apex  level    institutes  which  have  the  requisite    capabilities.    These      faculty members will take up training  of municipal engineers  as well as the training of engineers/architects in the private sector in RCC and masonry construction.  The first phase  of this programme   for imparting training  to 10000 engineers  will be

completed within  a period  of three years.  The trained faculty members   of the leading  engineering    colleges  will  also    assist    the  State  Governments  in  the detailed evaluation  of lifeline  buildings and their retrofitting, wherever necessary.

4.10 It has been  decided  to include  earthquake  engineering  education in the engineering    colleges    at  undergraduate  level.    The  course    curriculum  for  this purpose has already been  finalized by a  group of experts taken from IITs and will be  introduced  in the engineering  colleges within an year.  A system  of special audit  of buildings is being put  in place with a  view to  ensuring  that the new constructions conform  to the latest  building byelaws, which have been  reviewed and revised recently by Bureau of Indian Standards.

4.11 While  these mitigation measures will take care  of the new  constructions, the problem  of  unsafe  existing  buildings stock  would still  remain.  It will not be  possible  to  address  the  entire  existing  building  stock,  therefore  the  life  line buildings like hospitals, schools or buildings where people congregate like cinema halls,  multi-storied  apartments  are  being  focussed  on.    The  States  have  been advised  to  have  these  buildings  assessed  and  where  necessary  retrofitted.    The Ministry of Finance have been requested to advise the financial institutions to give loans  for  retrofitting  on  easy  terms.    Insofar  as  the  private  housing  stock  is concerned emphasis is placed on awareness generation.

4.12 An earthquake  mitigation  project  has been finalized  for reducing  the vulnerability  to earthquakes.  The programme includes  detailed  evaluation and retrofitting    of    lifeline  buildings  such  as    hospitals,  schools,  water  and  power supply units, telecommunication buildings, airports/airport control towers, railway stations, bus stands and important  administrative buildings.  The programme  also includes  training of more  than one hundred thousand  masons for  earthquake  resistant      constructions.    Besides,  assistance  will  be  provided

under this project  to the State Governments to put in place  appropriate  techno legal regime.

4.13 An accelerated   urban  earthquake vulnerability reduction programme has been taken up in  38 cities in seismic  zones III, IV &amp; V with population  of  half a million  and above.  Sensitization workshop  for engineers/architects, government functionaries  and voluntary  organizations have already  been held in  36  of the 38 cities.    Disaster  mitigation  and  preparedness    plans    are  under  preparation  in these cities.  Awareness  generation  campaign has already been  undertaken.  The orientation  courses  for  engineers  and  architects  have  been  organized  to  impart knowledge    about    seismically    safe  construction  and  implementation    of  BIS norms.    This  programme    will  be  further  extended    to  166  earthquake    prone districts in seismic  zones IV &amp; V.

4.14 Rural  housing    and    community  assets    for  vulnerable    sections  of  the population  are  created  at  a  fairly  large  scale by  the  Ministry    of  Rural Development  under  the  Indira    Awas  Yojna(IAY)  and  Sampooran  Grameen Rojgar  Yojna(SGRY).    About  250  thousand    small    but  compact    units  are constructed  every  year,    besides  community  assets  such  as    community  centres, recreation  centres,  anganwadi  centres  etc.    Technology  support    is  provided    by about  two hundred  rural  housing  centres spread over the entire  country.  The Ministry  of  Rural Development  are  now under  the process of revising  their guidelines for construction of such dwelling  units  by incorporating  appropriate earthquake/cyclone  resistant  features.  Training to the functionaries  in the rural housing  centres  will be organized  through  the  Ministry of  Home Affairs .  This initiative is expected to go a long way for the construction  and popularisation of seismically  safe construction  at village/block level.

4.15 A  National  Core  Group  on  Cyclone  Monitoring  &amp;  Mitigation  has  been constituted. Experts from Indian Meteorological Department, National Centre for Medium  Range  Weather  Forecasting,  Central Water  Commission,  National Remote Sensing Agency and Indian Space Research Organisation have been made the Members  of  the  Core  Group,  besides  administrators  from  the  relevant Ministries/Departments and State Governments vulnerable to cyclones. The Group has  been  assigned  with  the  responsibility  of  looking  warning  protocols  for cyclones; coordination mechanism between different Central and State Ministries/Departments/Organisations; mechanism for dissemination of warning to the  local  people  and;  cyclone  mitigation  measures  required  to  be  taken  for  the coastal States. The Group will also suggest short-term and long-term measures on technology upgradation.

- 4.16 A  cyclone  mitigation  project  has  been  formulated.  The  project  inter  alia includes  components  on  strengthening  of  monitoring/warning  systems,  coastal shelter  belt  plantation,  mangrove  plantation,  construction  of  cyclone  shelters, storm  surge  modeling  and  water  envelope  studies.  The  focus  will  be  on  regeneration of coastal shelter belt plantation and mangrove plantation where these have degenerated. The location of the cyclone shelters will be decided in such a manner that no person in the vulnerable zone is required to walk more than two kilometers to reach a cyclone shelter. The cyclone shelters will be multi purpose units  to  be  run  as  schools  or  community  centres  in  normal  times  and  will  have capacity  to house  3000  to  5000  persons  with  adequate  number  of  toilets, community  kitchen  and  other  facilities.  Areas  will  be  identified  for  providing shelter to livestock.

4.17 In the engineering designs for construction, special attention will be paid to the  attachment  of  roof  to  the  dwelling  units  so  as  to  make  such  units  cyclone

proof,  besides  incorporating  earthquake  resistant  features.  The  project  will  be taken up shortly and is expected to be completed over a period of five years.

4.18 A  Disaster  Risk  Management  Programme  has  been  taken  up  with  the assistance  from  UNDP,  USAID and European Union in 169 most hazard prone districts in 17 States including all the 8 North Eastern State. The implementation of the project commenced from October, 2002 and is expected to be concluded by December, 2007. The programme components include awareness generation and public education, preparedness, planning and capacity building, developing appropriate policies, institutional, administrative, legal and techno-legal regime at State, District, Block, village, urban local body and ward levels for vulnerability reduction.

4.19 Under this programme Disaster Management Plans have been prepared for about  3500  villages,  250  Gram  Panchayat,  60  blocks  and  15  districts.  Elected representatives of over 8000 Panchayati Raj Institutions have already been trained, besides  imparting  training  to  Members  of  voluntary  organisations.  Over  20000 Government functionaries have been trained in disaster mitigation and preparedness at different levels. About 600 engineers and 220 architects have been trained  under  this  programme  in  vulnerability  assessment  of  lifeline  buildings. Training is being imparted to master trainers under the programme. More than 600 master trainers and 1000 teachers have already been trained in different districts in disaster  mitigation.    Disaster  Management  Committees  consisting  of  elected representatives, civil society members, Civil Defence volunteers and Government functionaries  have  been  constituted  at  all  levels  including  village/urban  local body/ward levels. Disaster Management Teams have been constituted in villages and are being imparted training in basic functions of first aid, rescue, evacuation and related issues. The thrust of the programme is to build up capabilities of the community since the community is invariably the first responder. During the last

15 months, it has been experienced that the capacity building of the community has  been  very  helpful  even  in  normal  situations  when  isolated  instances  of drowning,  burns  etc.  take  place.  With  the  creation  of  awareness  generation  on disaster mitigation, the community will be able to function as a well-knit unit in case of any emergency. Mock drills are carried out from time to time under the close supervision of Disaster Management Committees. The Disaster Management Committees and Disaster Management Teams have been established by notifications  issued  by  the  State  Governments  which  will  ensure  that  the  entire system  is  institutionalized  and  does  not  disintegrate  after  the  conclusion  of  the programme. The key points being stressed under this programme are the need to ensure sustainability of the programme, development of training modules; manuals and codes, up-scaling partnerships in excellence, focused attention to awareness generation campaigns; institutionalization of disaster management committees and disaster  management  teams,  disaster  management  plans  and  mock-drills  and establishment of techno-legal regimes.

4.20 Human Resource Development at all levels is critical to institutionalization of  disaster  mitigation  strategy.  The  National  Centre  for  Disaster  Management  at the  national  level  has  been  upgraded  and  designated  as  the  National  Institute  of Disaster Management. It is being developed as a Regional Centre of Excellence in Asia.  The  National  Institute  of  Disaster  Management  will  develop  training modules  at  different  levels,  undertake  training  of  trainers  and  organize  training programmes for planners, administrators and command functionaries. Besides, the other functions assigned to the National Institute of Disaster Management include development of exhaustive National level information base on disaster management policies,  prevention  mechanisms,  mitigation  measures;  formulation of  disaster  management  code  and  providing  consultancy  to  various  States  in strengthening  their disaster management  systems  and  capacities  as  well  as

preparation of disaster management plans and strategies for hazard mitigation and disaster response.

- 4.21 Disaster Management faculties have already been created in 29 State level training institutes located in 28 States. These faculties are being directly supported by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The State Training Institutions take up several focused  training  programmes  for  different  target  groups  within  the  State.  The Disaster Management faculties in these Institutes are being further strengthened so as to enable them to develop as Institutes of Excellence for a specific disaster. This system has already been institutionalized and is being further strengthened so as to make it a focal point in each State for development of human resources in disaster mitigation and preparedness. Assistance to the State level training institutes will be provided by the National Institute of Disaster Management in the development of training/capsules training modules for different functionaries at different levels.
- 4.22 Large-scale awareness generation bringing out specific do's and don'ts is crucial to disaster mitigation. A Steering Committee on mass-media campaign has been constituted for this purpose. The Committee is in the process of developing a profile for taking up mass media campaign through audio, video and print media as well as publicity through pamphlets, posters, bus back panels at all levels. The posters would be prominently displayed at buildings like Primary Health Centres, Community  Centres,  schools  and  such  other  places  where  villagers  normally congregate for community activity.  The Corporate sector is also being associated with the dissemination of campaign.
- 4.23 Disaster management as a subject in Social Sciences has been introduced in the school curriculum for Class VIII from the current academic year. The Central Board of Secondary Education which has introduced the curriculum runs a very large  number  of  schools  throughout  the  country  and  the  course  curriculum  is

invariably  followed  by  the  State  Boards  of  Secondary  Education.  Several  State Governments have already introduced the same curriculum in Class VIII from the current academic year. Syllabus for Class IX and X has been finalized and will be introduced in the course curriculum from April, 2004 and April, 2005 respectively.

4.24 In order to assist the State Governments in capacity building and awareness generation activities and to learn from past experiences including sharing of best practices, the Ministry of Home Affairs has compiled/prepared a set of resource materials  developed  by  various  organisations/institutions  to  be  replicated  and disseminated by State Governments based on their vulnerabilities after translating it  into  the  local  languages.  The  voluminous  material  which  runs  in  about  10000 pages  has  been  divided  into  4  broad  sections  in  7  volumes.  These  sections coverplanning to cope with disasters; education and training; construction toolkit; and  information,  education  and  communication  toolkit  including  multi-media resources on disaster mitigation and preparedness. The Planning section contains material for analyzing a community's risk, development of Preparedness. mitigation  and  disaster  management  plans,  coordinating  available  resources  and implementing measures for risk reduction. The model bye-laws, DM Policy, Act and  model  health  sector  plan  have  also  been  included.  Education  and  Training includes material for capacity building and upgradation of skills of policy makers, administrators,  trainers,  engineers  etc.  in  planning  for  and  mitigating  against natural  disasters.  Basic  and  detailed  training  modules  in  disaster  preparedness have  been  incorporated  along  with  training  methodologies  for  trainers,  for community preparedness and manuals for training at district, block, panchayat and village levels. For creating a disaster-resistant building environment, the Construction  Toolkit  addresses  the  issue  of  seismic  resistant  construction  and retrofitting  of  existing  buildings.  BIS  Codes,  manuals  and  guidelines  for  RCC, Masonry and other construction methodologies as also for repair and retrofitting of masonry and low-rise buildings have been included.

4.25 IEC  material seeks to generate awareness  to induce mitigation and preparedness measures for risk reduction  Material and strategies used by various States  and  international  organisations,  including  tips  on  different  hazards,  have been incorporated along with multi-media CDs on disasters. The material has been disseminated to all the State Governments/UT Administrations with the request to have the relevant material, based on the vulnerability of each district, culled out, translated into local languages and disseminate it widely down to the village level.

4.26 The various prevention and mitigation measures outlined above are aimed at  building  up  the  capabilities  of  the  communities,  voluntary  organisations  and Government functionaries at all levels. Particular stress is being laid on ensuring that  these  measures  are  institutionalized  considering  the  vast  population  and  the geographical  area  of  the  country.  This  is  a  major  task  being  undertaken  by  the Government to put in place mitigation measures for vulnerability reduction. This is just a beginning. The ultimate goal is to make prevention and mitigation a part of normal day-to-day life. The above mentioned initiatives will be put in place and information  disseminated  over  a  period  of  five  to  eight  years.  We  have  a  firm conviction that with these measures in place, we could say with confidence that disasters like Orissa cyclone and Bhuj earthquake will not be allowed to recur in this  country;  at  least  not  at  the  cost,  which  the  country  has  paid  in  these  two disasters  in  terms  of  human  lives,  livestock,  loss  of  property  and  means  of livelihood.

## SECTION V

## Preparedness

- 5.1 Mitigation  and  preparedness  measures  go  hand  in  hand  for  vulnerability reduction  and  rapid  professional  response  to  disasters.    The  Bhuj  earthquake  in January, 2001 brought out several inadequacies  in the system.  The  search and rescue  teams  had not been  trained professionally; specialized dog squad to look for live bodies under the debris  were not available; and there was no centralized resource inventory for emergency response.   Although army played a pivotal role in search  and  rescue    and  also  set  up  their  hospital  after  the  collapse  of Government hospital at Bhuj,  the need  for fully equipped  mobile hospitals with trained personnel  was felt  acutely.  Despite these constraints, the response was fairly well organized.  However, had these constraints been  taken care  of before hand, the response  would have been even more professional and rapid which may have reduced  the loss of lives.  Specialist  search and  rescue  teams from other countries did reach  Bhuj.  However,  precious time was  lost  and even with these specialist teams it was not possible to cover all severely affected areas  as quickly as    the  Government    would  have  desired.    It  was,  therefore,  decided    that  we should  remove these inadequacies  and be in a stage  of preparedness  at all times.
- 5.2 The Central Government are now in the process of training and equipping 96 specialist search and rescue teams,  with each team consisting of 45 personnel including doctors, paramedics, structural engineers etc.  Ten teams have already been trained.  These teams will be located at various centres around the country for specialised response.  These teams will have the latest equipment as also dog squads for locating survivors in the debris.

- 5.3 Apart  from  specialist  search  &amp;  rescue  units,  it  has  been  decided    that personnel  of  Central  Police  Organisations  should  also  be    imparted  training    in search and rescue so that they can be  requisitioned to the site  of incident without loss of time.  Pending arrival of the specialist teams, the battalions located near the site of incident  would be deployed immediately.  For this purpose, a curriculum has been drawn up and integrated into the training  curriculum of CPMFs.
- 5.4 The States have also been advised  to set up their own specialist teams for responding to disasters.  Assistance will be provided  to the State Governments for training    their    trainers    at  the  national  institutes  already  designated  for  this purpose.  The State Governments' search and rescue  teams  to be constituted from the State Police will be equipped  to meet the requirement.  For this purpose,  the State Governments  have been authorised  to utilize  10%  of the annual allocation made under the Contingency Relief Fund for purchase of equipments.
- 5.5 Fourteen Regional Response Centres  are being set up in different parts of the country .  These centres will have response teams and equipment and resources for being able to response to any hazard/calamity in the neighbouring States.
- 5.6 A Steering Committee has been constituted  in the Ministry  to oversee the creation  of capabilities  for emergency response.
- 5.7 A 200 bedded mobile hospital, fully trained and equipped  is being  set up by the  Ministry    of  Health  and  attached  to    a  leading    Government    hospital  in Delhi.    Three  additional    mobile    hospitals  with  all  medical  and  emergency equipments  are proposed  to be located in different parts of the country.  These mobile hospitals will also be attached  to the leading  Government hospitals  in the country.    This  will  enable    the  mobile  hospitals    to  extend  assistance  to  the hospitals  with which  they are attached  in  normal time.  They will be airlifted

during  emergencies  with  additional  doctors/paramedics  taken  from  the  hospitals with which the mobile hospitals are attached to the site of disaster.

- 5.8 It is proposed  to purchase  dedicated aircraft  and helicopters  with a view to  reducing  the    response  time.    The  issue  is  pending  for  consideration    and approval of Empowered  Group  of Ministers on  Disaster Management.  Once the airlift facilities are  developed  for exclusive  use for disaster  management, it will be  possible  to  provide  airlift    facilities  to  specialist    search  and  rescue  teams, mobile  hospitals and equipments.
- 5.9 In  order    to  professionalise    the  response,  it  is  proposed  to  introduce  the Incident  Command  System in the country.  This system provides  for specialist incident command teams with  an Incident Commander  and officers trained  in different aspects of  incident management - logistics, operations, planning, safety, media  management  etc.    The  incident  Command  System  has  been  finalized keeping  in view  the  systems  and   procedures prevalent  in our country  by dovetailing  it in the existing  governmental machinery  already in position.  The training  of trainers  in the Incident Command  System has  already commenced  at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration at Mussoori which has been designated as the nodal training institutes for this purpose.
- 5.10 A  web-enabled  centralised  data  base  for  the  India  Disaster  Resource Network  has  been    operationalzed.    The  network  will  ensure  quick    access  to resources  to minimise  response time  in emergencies.  The list of resources  to be updated  in the system has been finalized.  It has 226 items. About 60,000 records in  481  districts throughout  the country have already   been  uploaded since Ist September,  2003  when  the  India  Disaster  Resource  Network  was  formally inaugurated.  The system will give, at the touch of the button, location of specific equipments/specialist  resources  as  well  as      the  Controlling  authority  for  that

resource so that it can be mobilized for response in the shortest possible time.  The data base will be available simultaneously  at the district, state  and national levels.

5.11 The  States are being persuaded to set up control rooms/emergency operations centres at the state and district level.  Assistance  for  construction and purchase  of equipments  for control rooms is  being provided.  The control rooms, which will function round the clock, will be composite control rooms to look after law  and  order    issues  as  well  as  disaster    management.        Equipments  are  also being  provided    for  these  control  rooms  under  the  disaster  risk    management programme.

- 5.12 Communication  is  a  major  bottleneck  in  case    of  any  major  disaster particularly when the traditional network system already  in force brake down.  In order  to  strengthen  communications,  it  has  been    decided    that  police  network (POLNET) will  also be used for  disaster management. For this purpose POLNET communication facility  will be extended to District Magistrates, Sub Divisional Magistrates  as  well  as    the  Control  Rooms.    For  emergency  communication, mobile  satellite  based units which can be transported  to the site  of the disaster are being procured. A  group was  constituted to draw a comprehensive communication  plan    for  disaster  management    and  the  report  has  since  been received.    This  provides  for  a  dedicated  communication  system  for  disaster management with built in redundancies.
- 5.13 The Geographical Information System (GIS) data base  is an effective  tool for emergency responders to access  information in terms of  crucial parameters for  the  disaster    affected    areas.    The  crucial  parameters  include  location  of  the public facilities, communication links and transportation network at national, state and district levels.  The GIS data base  already available  with different  agencies of the Government is being upgraded  and the gaps  are proposed to be bridged.  A

project  for this purpose  is being drawn up  with a view  to institutionalising the arrangements.    The  data  base  will  provide  multi  layered    maps  on  district  wise basis.  Three maps taken in conjunction with the satellite images available for a particular area will enable the district administration as well as State Governments to  carry out hazard zonation and vulnerability assessment, as well as coordinate response after a disaster.

- 5.14 In order to further strengthen  the capacity  for response,  the fire services are proposed to be developed  into multi hazard response units as is the normal practice  in several other countries.  It is proposed to provide rescue tenders  in addition to fire  tenders to each fire unit and fill up  all gaps  upto   sub-divisional level.  Hazmat vans will be provided  to  State   capitals and  metropolitan cities. This will necessitate recruitment of additional fire men and drivers and intensive training  required  to  be  provided  to  enable  them  to  function  as  efficient  of  all purpose response units.  A project for development  of fire service into all hazard response  units  has also been  finalized  and submitted for obtaining necessary financial approval.
- 5.15 India has a large network of Civil  Defence and  Home Guards volunteers. The existing strength  is about 1.2 million.  However,  this organization  has not so far been  associated with disaster mitigation, preparedness and response functions.  It is  proposed to  revamp  the Civil Defence  organization to enable them to discharge  a key responsibility in all the facets   of disaster  management including  preparedness.  A proposal in this regard  has been finalized and is under consideration of the Government.
- 5.16 Standard Operating Procedures are being laid down to ensure all the steps required  to  be  taken  for  disaster  management  are  put  in  place.    The  Standard Operating Procedure will also in encompass response, besides preparedness.

- 5.17 With the development   of disaster management   committees and disaster management teams at all levels including village/urban local body/ward level, the stage  will  be      set  for  comprehensive  preparedness  measures  to  be  taken  with active participation of the community and non-governmental organizations.
- 5.18 With the mitigation and preparedness measures outlined in this and earlier section  in  position,  it  is  expected  that  natural  hazards  could  be  handled  more efficiently  so as to ensure  that these hazards  did not get converted into disasters.

## SECTION VI

## Conclusion

- 6.1 Disaster Management  has to be a multi-disciplinary and pro-active approach.  Besides  various  measures  for  putting  in  place  institutional  and  policy framework,  disaster  prevention,  mitigation  and  preparedness  enunciated  in  this paper  and  initiatives  being  taken  by  the  Central  and  State  Governments,  the community, civil society organisations and media also have a key role to play in achieving our goal of moving together, towards a safer India. The message being put  across  is  that,  in  order  to  move  towards  safer  and  sustainable  national development, development projects should be sensitive towards disaster mitigation.
- 6.2 Our mission is vulnerability reduction to all types of hazards, be it natural or  manmade.  This  is  not  an  easy  task  to  achieve,  keeping  in  view  the  vast population,  and  the  multiple  natural  hazards  to  which  this  country  is  exposed. However, if we are firm in our conviction and resolve that the Government and the people  of  this  country  are  not  prepared  to  pay  the  price  in  terms  of  massive casualties  and  economic  losses,  the  task,  though  difficult,  is  achievable  and  we shall achieve it.
- 6.3 We  have  taken  the  first  few  but  significant  steps  towards  vulnerability reduction, putting in place prevention and mitigation measures and preparedness for  a  rapid  and  professional  response.  With  a  massive  awareness  generation campaign  and  building  up  of  capabilities  as  well  as  institutionalization  of  the entire mechanism through a techno legal and techno financial framework, we are gradually moving in the direction of sustainable development.

- 6.4 Our  vision  2020  is  to  build  a  safer  and  secure  India  through  sustained collective  effort,  synergy  of  national  capacities  and  people's  participation.  What looks a dream today will be transformed into reality in the next two decades. This is our goal and we shall strive to achieve this goal with a missionary zeal. The path ahead,  which  looks  difficult  today,  will  become  a  lot  easier  as  we  move  along together.

## MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS [NDM DIVISION ]

- 1. A review of  the  disaster  management  mechanism  was  carried  out  by  the Government of India after the Bhuj earthquake.    It was noted that there was need for building up holistic capabilities for disaster management - so as to be able to handle both natural and man-made disasters.  It was accordingly decided that the subject of Disaster Management be transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture to the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (excluding  drought  and  epidemics  and  those emergencies/disasters  which  were  specifically  allotted  to  other  Ministries).    The Government (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 were accordingly amended in February, 2002.  The actual transfer of work took place in June, 2002.
- 2. India has been very vulnerable to natural hazards and calamities.  The Bhuj earthquake accounted for 13805 deaths, the super cyclone in Orissa accounted for 9885  deaths.  Government are of the view that if appropriate mitigation measures had been taken these casualties could have been reduced significantly.
- 3. Each year disasters also account for loss of thousands of crores in terms of social and community assets.  It is clear that development cannot be sustainable without  building  in  mitigation  into  the  planning  process.      Keeping  the  above factors in view, the Government of India have brought about a change in policy which emphasizes mitigation, prevention and preparedness.  With the approval of Dy. Prime Minister, a strategic roadmap as given in the succeeding pages has been drawn up for reducing the country's vulnerability to disasters.  Action for reducing our vulnerabilities to disasters shall be taken in accordance with the roadmap. The roadmap  will  be  reviewed  every  two  years  to  see  if  any  change  in  direction  is necessary.

## DISASTER MANAGEMENT THE DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE

- 1. Five Year Plan documents have, historically, not included consideration of issues  relating to the management  and  mitigation  of  natural  disasters.  The traditional  perception  has  been  limited  to  the  idea  of  'calamity  relief',  which  is seen essentially as a non-plan item of expenditure. However, the impact of major disasters cannot be mitigated by the provision of immediate relief alone, which is the primary focus of calamity relief efforts. Disasters can have devastating effects on the economy;  they cause huge human  and  economic  losses, and can significantly  set  back  development  efforts  of  a  region  or  a  State.  Two  recent disasters, the Orissa Cyclone and the Gujarat Earthquake, are cases in point. With the kind of economic losses and developmental setbacks that the country has been suffering year after year, the development process needs to be sensitive towards disaster prevention and mitigation aspects. There is thus need to look at disasters from a development perspective as well.
- 2. Further,  although  disaster  management  is  not  generally  associated  with plan financing, there are in fact a number of plan schemes in operation, such as for drought proofing, afforestation, drinking water, etc., which deal with the prevention and mitigation of the impact of natural disasters. External assistance for post-disaster  reconstruction  and  streamlining  of  management  structures  also  is  a part of the Plan. A specific, centrally sponsored scheme on disaster management also exists. The Plan thus already has a defined role in dealing with the subject.
- 3. Recently, expert bodies have dwelt on the role of the Planning Commission  and  the  use  of  plan  funds  in  the  context  of  disaster  management. Suggestions have been made in this regard by the Eleventh Finance Commission, and also the High Powered Committee on Disaster Management. An approach on planning for safe development needs to be set out in the light of these suggestions.
- 4. This chapter reflects the considerations outlined above. It briefly outlines the global context and the Indian experience of disasters, sets out the institutional and  financial  arrangements  for  disaster  management  and  the  response  towards these in
- the country, looks at directions for improvement, and concludes with a strategy to facilitate planning for safe national development in the Tenth Plan period.

## THE GLOBAL CONTEXT

- 5. There has been an increase in the number of natural disasters over the past years,  and  with  it,  increasing  losses  on  account  of  urbanisation  and  population growth, as a result of which the impact of natural disasters is now felt to a larger extent.  According  to  the  United  Nations,  in  2001  alone,  natural  disasters  of medium to high range caused at least 25,000 deaths around the world, more than double the previous year, and economic losses of around US $ 36 billion. These figures  would  be  much  higher,  if  the  consequences  of  the  many  smaller  and unrecorded  disasters  that  cause  significant  losses  at  the  local  community  level were  to  be  taken  into  account.  Devastations  in  the  aftermath  of  powerful earthquakes that struck Gujarat, El Salvador and Peru; floods that ravaged many countries  in  Africa,  Asia  and  elsewhere;  droughts  that  plagued  Central  Asia including  Afghanistan,  Africa  and  Central  America;  the  cyclone  in  Madagascar and Orissa; and floods in Bolivia are global events in recent memory. However, what is disturbing is the knowledge that

these trends of destruction and devastation are on the rise instead of being kept in check.

- 6. Natural disasters are not bound by political boundaries and have no social or  economic  considerations.  They  are  borderless  as  they  affect  both  developing and developed countries. They are also merciless, and as such the vulnerable tend to  suffer  more  at  the  impact  of  natural  disasters.  For  example,  the  developing countries are much more seriously affected in terms of the loss of lives, hardship borne by population and the percentage of their GNP lost. Since 1991, two-third of the victims
- of  natural  disasters  were  from  developing  countries,  while  just  2  per  cent  were from highly developed nations. Those living in developing countries and especially those with limited resources tend to be more adversely affected. With the alarming rise in

the natural disasters and vulnera-bility per se, the world community is strengthening its efforts to cope with it.

- 7. As a number of the most vulnerable regions are in India, natural disaster management  has  emerged  as  a  high  priority  for  the  country.  Going  beyond  the historical focus on relief and rehabilitation after the event, we now have to look ahead and plan for disaster preparedness and mitigation, in order that the periodic shocks to our development efforts are minimized.

## THE INDIAN EXPERIENCE Regional Vulnerabilities

- 8. Physical  vulnerability  relates  to  the  physical  location  of  people,  their proximity  to  the  hazard  zone  and  standards  of  safety  maintained  to  counter  the effects. For instance, some people are vulnerable to flood only because they live in a flood prone area. Physical vulnerability also relates to the technical capacity of buildings  and  structures  to  resist  the  forces  acting  upon  them  during  a  hazard event.

|             | 71 Box                                             |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|             | INDIA S KEY VULNERABILITIES                        |
| Gujarat are | vulnerable to cyclones;                            |
|             | 68 per cent of net sown area Is vulnerable to      |
|             | 55 per cent of totdl area is in Seismic Zones Il V |

| landslides  |                                                    |

- 9. The  extent  to  which  a  population  is affected  by  a  calamity  does  not  purely  lie  in the  physical  components of vulnerability, but is  contextual also to the prevailing social and economic  conditions  and  it's  consequential effect on  human  activities within a given society. Research in areas affected by earthquakes indicates that single parent families, women, handicapped people, children and the aged are particularly

vulnerable social groups. The geophysical setting with unplanned and inadequate developmental activity is a cause for increased losses during disasters. In the case of India, the contribution of over-population to high population density, which in turn results in escalating losses, deserves to be noted. This factor sometimes tends to be as important as physical vulnerability attributed to geography and infrastructure alone.

- 10. The continent of Asia is particularly vulnerable to disaster strikes. Between the  years  1991  to  2000  Asia  has  accounted  for  83  per  cent  of  the  population affected by disasters globally. While the number of people affected in the rest of the  world  were  1,11,159,  in  Asia  the  number  was  5,54,439.Within  Asia,  24  per cent of deaths due to disasters occur in India, on account of its size, population and vulnerability.  Floods  and  high  winds  account  for  60  per  cent  of  all  disasters  in India.  While  substantial  progress  has  been  made  in  other  sectors  of  human development, there is need to do more towards mitigating the effect of disasters.
- 11. Many parts of the Indian sub-continent are susceptible to different types of disasters owing to the unique topographic and climatic characteristics. About 54 per cent of the sub-continent's landmass is vulnerable to earthquakes while about 4 crore hectares is vulnerable to periodic floods. The decade 1990-2000, has been

one of very high disaster losses within the country, losses in the Orissa Cyclone in 1999, and later, the Gujarat Earthquake in 2001 alone amount to several thousand crore of Rupees, while the total expenditure on relief and reconstruction in Gujarat alone has been to the tune of Rs 11,500 crore.

- 12. Similarly,  the  country  has  suffered  four  major  earthquakes  in  the  span  of last  fifty  years  along  with  a  series  of  moderate  intensity  earthquakes  that  have occurred  at  regular  intervals.  Since  1988,  six  earthquakes  have  struck  different parts of the country. These caused considerable human and property losses.

Table 7.1 Major Earthquakes in India, 1988-2001

- 13. Disasters lead to enormous economic losses that are both immediate  as  well  as  long  term  in nature and demand additional revenues.  Also,  as  an  immediate  fallout, disasters reduce revenues from the affected region due to lower levels of

economic  activity  leading  to  loss  of  direct  and  indirect  taxes.  In  addition, unplanned  budgetary  allocation  to  disaster  recovery  can  hamper  development interventions and lead to unmet developmental targets.

- 14. Disasters may also reduce availability of new investment, further constricting  the  growth  of  the  region.  Besides,  additional  pressures  may  be imposed  on  finances  of  the  government  through  investments  in  relief  and rehabilitation work.
- 15. In the recent earthquake in Gujarat, more  than  14,000  lives  were  lost,  ten  lakh houses  were  damaged  and  the  asset  loss  has been indicated to be worth 15,000 crore. Tables 7.2 to 7.5 give an indication of the magnitude of the  damage and losses incurred by the country in recent natural disasters.
- 16. The dimensions of the damage, as evident in the tables and the diagram 7.1

emphasise  the  point  that  natural  disasters  cause  major  setbacks  to  development and  it  is  the  poorest  and  the  weakest  that  are  the  most  vulnerable  to  disasters. Given the high frequency with which one or the other part of the country suffers due to disasters, mitigating the impact of disasters must be an integral component of our development planning and be part of our poverty reduction strategy.

## INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS

- 17. The country with its federal system of Government has specific roles for the  Central and State Governments. However, the subject of disaster management does not specifically find

mention in any of the three lists in the 7th Schedule of the Indian Constitution, where  subjects  under  the  Central  and  State  Governments  as  also  subjects  that come under both are specified. On the legal front, there is no enactment either of the Central or

of  any  State  Government  to  deal  with  the  management  of  disasters  of  various types in a comprehensive manner.

- 18. The country has an integrated administrative machinery for management of disasters at the National,  State, District and  Sub-District  levels.  The  basic responsibility of undertaking rescue, relief and rehabilitation measures in the event of natural disasters, as at present, is that of the State Governments concerned. The Central Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing financial and logistic support.

## Central Level

- 19. The  dimensions  of  response  at  the  level  of  the  Central  Government  are determined in accordance with the existing policy of financing relief expenditure and keeping in view the factors like:
- (i) the gravity of a natural disaster;
- (ii) the scale of the relief operation necessary; and

- (iii) the requirements of Central assistance for augmenting financial resources and logistic support at the disposal of the State Government.
- 20. The  Contingency  Action  Plan  (CAP)  identifies  initiatives  required  to  be taken by various Central Ministries and Public Departments in the wake of natural calamities.  It  sets  down  the  procedures  and  determines  the  focal  points  in  the administrative  machinery  to  facilitate  launching  of  relief  and  rescue  operations without delay.
- 21. The  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  is  the  nodal  Ministry  for  coordination  of relief and response and overall natural disaster management, and the Department of  Agriculture  &amp;  Cooperation  is  the  nodal  Ministry  for  drought  management. Other Ministries are assigned the responsibility of providing emergency support in case of disasters that fall in their purview as indicated in Table 7.6.

Table 7.6 Ministries Responsible for Various Categories of Disasters

| Chemical Disasters   |        |
|----------------------|--------|
|                      | Energy |

The  following  decision-making  and  standing bodies are responsible for disaster management at the Central level:

- · Union Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister.
- ·  Empowered Group of Ministers, headed by the Deputy Prime Minister
- · National Crisis Management  Committee (NCMC), under the chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary.
- · Crisis Management Group (CMG): under the chairmanship of the Central Relief Commissioner  comprising  senior  officers  from  the  various  Ministries  and  other concerned Departments which reviews contingency plans, measures required for dealing  with  a  natural  disaster,  and  co-ordinates  the  activities  of  the  Central Ministries and the State Governments in relation to disaster preparedness response and relief.
- · Technical Organizations, such as the Indian Meteorological Department (cyclone/earthquake), Central Water Commission (floods), Building and Material Promotion  Council  (construction  laws),  Bureau  of  Indian  Standards  (norms), Defence Research &amp; Development Organization (nuclear/biological), Directorate General  Civil  Defence  provide  specific  technical  support  to  coordination  of disaster response and management functions.

- · The setting up of a National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is being contemplated  by  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  as  the  proposed  apex  structure within  the  government  for  the  purpose.  Amongst  other  major  organizational initiatives, it is proposed to:
- (a) establish a specialised and earmarked response team for dealing with nuclear/ biological/chemical disasters;
- (b) establish search and rescue teams in each State;
- (c) strengthen communication systems in the North Eastern Region.

## State Government

- 22. The responsibility to cope with natural disasters is essentially that of the State Government. The role of the Central Government is supportive in terms of supplementation of physical and financial resources.  The  Chief  Secretary  of  the State  heads  a  state  level  committee  which  is  in  overall  charge  of  the  relief operations  in  the  State  and  the  Relief  Commissioners  who  are  in  charge  of  the relief  and  rehabilitation  measures  in  the  wake  of  natural  disasters  in  their  States function under
- the  overall  direction  and  control  of  the  state  level  committee.  In  many  states, Secretary, Department of Revenue, is also in-charge of relief. State Governments usually  have  relief  manuals  and  the  districts  have  their  contingency  plan  that  is updated from time to time.

## District and Local Level

- 23. The  district  administration  is  the  focal  point  for  implementation  of  all governmental plans and activities. The actual day-to-day function of administering relief is the responsibility of the Collector/ District Magistrate/Deputy Commissioner  who  exercises  coordinating  and  supervising  powers  over  all departments at the district level. Though it may not be a common phenomenon, there exists by and large in districts also a district level relief committee consisting of officials and non- officials.
- 24. The  73rd  and  74th  constitutional  amendments  recognise  Panchayati  Raj Institutions  as  'Institutions  of  self-  government'.  The  amendment  has  also  laid down  necessary  guidelines for the structure of their composition, powers, functions, devolution of finances, regular holding of elections and reservation of seats  for  weaker  sections  including  women.  These  local  bodies  can  be  effective instruments in tackling disasters through early warning system, relief distribution, providing shelter to the victims, medical assistance etc.

- 25. Other  than  the  national,  state,  district  and  local  levels,  there  are  various institutional  stakeholders  who  are  involved  in  disaster  management  at  various levels  in  the  country.  These  include  the  police  and  para-military  forces,  civil defence and home-guards, fire services, ex-servicemen, nongovernment organisations  (NGOs),  public  and  private  sector  enterprises,  media  and  HAM operators, all of whom have important roles to play.

## Armed Forces

- 26. The Indian Armed Forces are supposed to be called upon to intervene and take  on  specific  tasks  only  when  the  situation  is  beyond  the  capability  of  civil administration.  In  practice,  the  Armed  Forces  are  the  core  of  the  government's response capacity and tend to be the first responders of the Government of India in a  major  disaster.  Due  to  their  ability  to  organize  action  in  adverse  ground circumstances, speed of operational response and the resources and capabilities at their disposal, the Armed  Forces  have  historically  played  a  major  role  in emergency support functions such as communications, search and rescue operations,  health  and  medical  facilities,  transportation,  power,  food  and  civil supplies, public works and engineering, especially in the immediate aftermath of disaster. Disaster management plans should incorporate the role expected of them so that the procedure for deploying them is smooth and quick.

## External Linkages

- 27. The Government of India is a member of various international organisations  in  the  field  of  disaster  response  and  relief.  While,  as  a  policy,  no requests for assistance or appeals are made to the international community in the event of a disaster, assistance offered suo moto is accepted. Linkages exist with the following organisations:
- a) UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), which has been  made  responsible  by  UN  General  Assembly  mandate  for  all  international disaster response.
- b)  United  Nations  Development Programme (UNDP), responsible for mitigation
- and prevention aspects of disaster management.
- c) UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) System.

Streamlining Institutional Arrangements for Disaster Response

- 28. Institutional  arrangements  for  disaster  response  are  the  heart  of  disaster management systems. There is no dearth of personnel, both civilian and military, experienced in handling situations arising out of natural disasters. However, there certainly  is  a  pressing  need  for  improvement  and  strengthening  of  existing institutional arrangements and systems in this regard to make the initial response to a disaster more effective and professional. Most of the resources and expertise needed already exist with the Government. What needs to be streamlined is how they should be integrated, trained and deployed. Some of the areas where improvement is urgently needed are:
- a)  Integrated  planning  for  disasters,  including  the  integration  of  relevant  Armed Forces formations into disaster management planning at all levels from District to State and Central Government.
- b)  Setting  up  of  a  modern,  permanent  national  command  centre  or  operations room,  with  redundant  communications  and  data  links  to  all  State  capitals.  The national  command  centre  or  operations  room  needs  to  be  manned  on  a  24-hour basis by professionals to cater for instant integrated response. There needs to be a properly equipped operations room at the State level as well.
- c) Establishment  of  a  national  stand  by,  quick  reaction  team  composed  of experienced  professionals,  both  military  and  civilian,  drawn  from  Central  and State Government staff to respond immediately by flying in a matter of hours an experienced response team to the locations when a disaster strikes. This team can be  organized  and  run  professionally  on  the  same  lines  as  the  United  Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams.
- d) Creation of urban search and rescue capacity at all levels, by establishing a fully equipped Search and Rescue unit, as part of the fire service in all State capitals,
- with trained  staff  and  modern  equipment  such  as  thermal  imagers,  acoustic  detection devices etc. This is of immediate relevance since a major weakness exposed in the Gujarat earthquake was a lack of specialised urban search and rescue capability in India.
- e) Media  policy  geared  to  handling  the  growing  phenomenon  of  real  time television reporting, which generates enormous political pressures on a government to respond rapidly and efficiently. This needs attention since the effect is going to increase, not decrease in future.
- f)  Closer  interface  with  and  better  understanding  of  the  international  system  for disaster  response,  and  putting  in  place,  systems  for  dealing  with  international

assistance once it comes in e.g., customs, immigration, foreign policy implications etc.  A  greater  appreciation  is  needed  of  the  speed  and  automation  of  modern international response to a natural disaster. Closer interaction is required between of

the Ministry of External Affairs and the relevant inter-national agencies concerned with disaster response.

- g) Standard procedures for dealing with domestic humanitarian and relief assistance

from non-government sources. Procedures and systems need to be set out to avoid confusion and ensure best utilisation of the assistance being offered, just as in the case of systems for international assistance.

- h)  Modern  unified  legislation  for  disaster  management.  In  view  of  the  current division of responsibilities between the State and Central Government into state, central and concurrent lists, there is a need to create a body of legislation dealing with  response  to  natural  disasters  and  other  emergencies,  clearly  delineating responsibilities and powers of each entity and specifying what powers or actions would need to be triggered on declaration of a disaster by the Government of India or  a  State  Government.  This  legislation  should  also  incorporate  the  current legislation  dealing  with  chemical  emergencies  that  has  been  created  by  the Ministry of Environment so that all emergencies are dealt with under one law. The legislation  should  include  clear  definitions  of  what  constitutes  a  disaster  at  a national level.

## FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS

## Financing of Relief Expenditures

- 29. The policy arrangements for meeting relief  expenditure  related  to  natural disasters are, by and large, based on the recommendations of successive finance commissions. The two main windows presently open for meeting such expenditures are the Calamity Relief Fund  (CRF)  and National Calamity Contingency  Fund  (NCCF).  The  Calamity  Relief  Fund  is  used  for  meeting  the expenditure  for  providing  immediate  relief  to  the  victims  of  cyclone,  drought, earthquake,  fire,  flood  and  hailstorm.  Expenditure  on  restoration  of  damaged capital works should ordinarily be met from the normal budgetary heads, except when it is to be incurred as part of providing immediate relief, such as restoration of drinking water sources or provision of shelters etc., or restoration of communication  links  for  facilitating  relief  operations.  The  amount  of  annual contribution to the CRF of each State for each of the financial years 2000-01 to 2004-05  is  as  indicated  by  the  Finance  Commission.  Of  the  total  contribution

indicated,  the  Government  of  India  contributes  75  per  cent  of  the  total  yearly allocation in the form of a non-plan grant, and the balance amount is contributed by the State Government concerned. A total of Rs. 11,007.59 crore was provided for the Calamity Relief Fund from 2000-05.

- 30. Pursuant  to  the    recommendations  of  the  Eleventh  Finance  Commission, apart  from  the  CRF,  a  National  Calamity  Contingency  Fund  (NCCF)  Scheme came  into  force  with  effect  from  the  financial  year  2000-01  and  would  be operative  till  the  end  of  the  financial  year  2004-05.  NCCF  is  intended  to  cover natural  calamities  like  cyclone,  drought,  earthquake,  fire,  flood  and  hailstorm, which  are  considered  to  be  of  severe  nature  requiring  expenditure  by  the  State Government in excess of the balances available in its own Calamity Relief Fund. The assistance from NCCF  is available only for immediate relief and rehabilitation.  Any  reconstruction  of  assets  or  restoration  of  damaged  capital should be financed through re-allocation of Plan funds. There is need for defining the arrangements in this regard.
- 31. The initial  corpus  of  the  National  Fund  is  Rs.500  crore,  provided  by  the Government  of  India.  This  fund  is  required  to  be  recouped  by  levy  of  special surcharge for a limited period on central taxes. An amount of about Rs.2,300 crore has  already  been  released  to  States  from  NCCF.  A  list  of  items  and  norms  of expenditure  for  assistance  chargeable  to  CRF/NCCF  in  the  wake  of  natural calamities is prescribed in detail from time to time.

## Financing of Disaster Management Through Five Year Plans

- 32. Although  not  specifically  addressed  in  Five  Year  Plan  documents  in  the past, the Government of India has a long history of using funds from the Plan for mitigating natural disasters. Funds are provided under Plan schemes i.e., various schemes  of  Government  of  India,  such  as  for  drinking  water,  employment generation, inputs for agriculture and flood control measures etc. There are also facilities  for  rescheduling  short-term  loans  taken  for  agriculture  purposes  upon certification  by  the  District/State  administration.  Central  Government's  assets/ infrastructure are to be repaired/rectified by the respective Ministry/Department of Government  of  India.  Besides  this,  at  the  occurrence  of  a  calamity  of  great magnitude,  funds  flow  from  donors,  both  local  and  international,  for  relief  and rehabilitation, and in few cases for long-term preparedness/ preventive measures. Funds for the latter purposes are also available from multilateral funding agencies such as the World Bank. These form part of the State Plan.

- 33. There  are  also  a  number  of  important  ongoing  schemes  that  specifically help  reduce  disaster  vulnerability.  Some  of  these  are:  Integrated  Wasteland Development  Programme  (IWDP),  Drought  Prone  Area  Programme  (DPAP), Desert  Development  Programme  (DDP),  Flood  Control  Programmes,  National Afforestation  &amp;    Ecodevelopment  Programme  (NA&amp;ED),  Accelerated  Rural Water Supply Programme (ARWSP), Crop Insurance, Sampurn Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY), Food for Work etc.

## Initiatives Proposed by Various Bodies Regarding Financing Under the

## Plan

- 34. References  have  recently  been  made  to  the  role  of  the  Plan  in  disaster anagement by the High Power Committee (HPC) on Disaster Management, as well as  by  the  Eleventh  Finance  Commission. The HPC was constituted in 1999 and submitted  its  Report  in  October  2001.  The  HPC  took  an  overview  of  all  recent disasters  (natural  as  well  as  manmade)  in  the  country  and  identified  common response and preparedness mechanisms on the basis of a series of consultations with a number  of  government,  non-government,  national and international agencies and media organisations. An important recommendation of the Committee was that at least 10 per cent of plan funds at the national, state and district  levels  be  earmarked  and  apportioned  for  schemes  which  specifically address  areas  such  as  prevention,  reduction,  preparedness  and  mitigation  of disasters.
- 35. The Eleventh Finance Commission too paid detailed attention to the issue of  disaster  management  and,  in  its  chapter  on  calamity  relief,  came  out  with  a number of recommendations, of which the following have a direct bearing on the Plan:
- (a)  Expenditure  on  restoration  of  infrastructure  and  other  capital  assets,  except
- those that  are  intrinsically  connected  with  relief  operations  and  connectivity  with  the affected area and population, should be met from the plan funds on priority basis.
- (b) Medium and long-term measures be devised by the concerned Ministries of the Government  of  India,  the  State  Governments  and  the  Planning  Commission  to reduce, and if possible, eliminate, the occurrences of these calamities by undertaking developmental works.
- (c)  The  Planning  Commission,  in  consultation  with  the  State  Governments  and concerned  Ministries,  should  be  able  to  identify  works  of  a  capital  nature  to

prevent the recurrence of specific calamities. These works may be funded under the Plan.

## PLANNING FOR SAFE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

- 36. Development programmes that go into promoting development at the local level have been left to the general exercise of planning. Measures need also to be taken  to  integrate  disaster  mitigation  efforts  at  the  local  level  with  the  general exercise  of  planning,  and  a  more  supportive  environment  created  for  initiatives towards managing of disasters at all levels: national, state, district and local. The future  blue-print  for  disaster  management  in  India  rests  on  the  premise  that  in today's  society  while  hazards,  both  natural  or  otherwise,  are  inevitable,  the disasters that follow need not be so and the society can be prepared to cope with them effectively whenever they occur. The need of the hour is to chalk out a multipronged strategy for total risk management, comprising prevention, preparedness, response  and  recovery  on  the  one  hand,  and  initiate  development  efforts  aimed towards  risk  reduction  and  mitigation,  on  the  other    Only  then  can  we  look forward to 'sustainable development.'

## Disaster Prevention  And  Preparedness  Measures  Information  and Research Network

- 37. Disaster prevention is intrinsically linked to preventive planning. Some of the important steps in this regard are:
- (a) Introduction of a comprehensive process of vulnerability analysis and objective risk assessment.
- (b) Building a robust and sound information database: A comprehensive database of the land use, demography, infrastructure developed at the national, state and local levels along with current information on climate, weather and man-made structures is crucial in planning, warning and assessment of disasters. In addition, resource  inventories  of  governmental  and  non-governmental  systems  including personnel  and  equipment  help  in  efficient  mobilisation  and  optimisation  of response measures.
- (c)  Creating  state-of-the-art  infrastructure:  The  entire  disaster  mitigation  game plan  must  necessarily  be  anchored  to  frontline  research  and  development  in  a holistic mode. State-of-the art technologies available worldwide need to be made

available in India for upgradation of the disaster management system; at the same time,  dedicated  research  activities  should  be  encouraged,  in  all  frontier  areas related  to  disasters  like  biological,  space  applications,  information  technology, nuclear  radiation etc., for a continuous flow of high quality basic information for sound disaster management planning,

- (d) Establishing Linkages between all knowledge- based institutions: A National Disaster Knowledge Network, tuned to the felt needs of a multitude of users like disaster  managers,  decision  makers,  community  etc.,  must  be  developed  as  the network of networks to cover natural, manmade and biological disasters in all their varied dimensions,

## Capacity Building, Training &amp; Education

- 38. Personnel involved in the exercise have to draw upon knowledge of best practices  and  resources  available  to  them.  Information  and  training  on  ways  to better respond to and mitigate disasters to the responders go a long way in building the capacity and resilience of the country to reduce and prevent disasters. Training is an integral part of capacity building as trained personnel respond much better to different disasters and appreciate the need for preventive measures. The directions in this regard are:
- (a)  The  multi-sectoral  and  multi-hazard  prevention  based  approach  to  disaster management requires specific professional inputs. Professional training in disaster management should be built into the existing pedagogic research and education. Specialised courses for disaster management may be developed by universities and professional teaching institutions, and disaster management should be treated as a distinct academic  and  professional  discipline,  something  that  the  American education  system  has  done  successfully.  In  addition  to  separate  diploma/degree courses in disaster management, the subject needs to be discussed  and taught as a specific component in professional and specialised courses like medicine, nursing, engineering, environmental sciences, architecture, and town and country planning.
- (b)  The  focus  towards  preventive  disaster  management  and  development  of  a national  ethos  of  prevention  calls  for  an  awareness  generation  at  all  levels.  An appropriate component of disaster awareness at the school level will help increase awareness among children and, in many cases, parents and other family members through these children. Curriculum development with a focus towards dissemination

of  disaster  related  information  on  a  sustained  basis,  covering  junior,  middle  and high schools may be worked out by the different school boards in the country.

- (c) Training facilities for government personnel involved in disaster management are conducted at the national level by the National Centre for Disaster Management  (NCDM)  at  the  Indian  Institute  of  Public  Administration,  in  New Delhi which functions as the nodal institution in the country for training, research and documentation of disasters. At the State level, disaster management cells operating within the State Administrative Training Institutes (ATIs) provide the necessary training. Presently,  24  ATIs  have  dedicated  faculties.  There  is  a  need  for  strengthening specialised training, including training of personnel in disaster response.
- (d)  Capacity  building  should  not  be  limited  to  professionals  and  personnel involved in disaster  management  but  should  also  focus  on  building  the  knowledge,  attitude and skills of a community to cope with the effects of disasters. Identification and training of volunteers from the community towards first response measures as well as  mitigation  measures  is  an  urgent  imperative.  A  programme  of  periodic  drills should  be  introduced  in  vulnerable  areas  to  enable  prompt  and  appropriate community response in the event of a disaster, which can help save valuable lives.
- 39. Capacity building for effective disaster management therefore needs to be grounded and linked to the community and local level responders on the one hand and also to the institutional mechanism of the State and the Nation on the other.

## Community Level Initiatives

- 40. The  goal  of  any  disaster  management  initiative  is  to  build  a  disaster resistant/resilient community equipped with safer living and sustainable livelihoods to serve its own development purposes. The community is also the first responder in any disaster situation, thereby emphasising the need for community level initiatives in managing disasters. To encourage such initiatives, the following are required:
- (a) Creating awareness through disaster education and training and information dissemination are necessary steps for empowering the community to cope with disasters.

- (b) Community based approach followed by most NGOs and Community Based Organisations (CBOs) should be incorporated in the disaster management system as an effective vehicle of community participation.
- (c)  Within  a  vulnerable  community,  there  exist  groups  that  are  more  vulnerable like women and children, aged and infirm and physically challenged people who need  special  care  and  attention  especially  during  disaster  situations.  Efforts  are required for identifying such vulnerable groups and providing special assistance in terms of evacuation, relief, aid and medical attention to them in disaster situations.
- 41. Management  of  disasters  should  therefore  be  an  interface  between  a community  effort  to  mitigate  and  prevent  disasters  as  also  an  effort  from  the government machinery to buttress and support popular initiatives.

## Strengthening of Plan Activities

- 42. Given the pervasive nature of disasters and the widespread havoc caused by  some  of  them,  planned  expenditure  on  disaster  mitigation  and  prevention measures in addition to the CRF is required. The Central Sector Scheme of Natural Disaster  Management  Programmes  has  been  implemented  since  1993-94  by  the Department  of  Agriculture  and  Co-operation  with  the  objective  to  focus  on disaster preparedness with emphasis on mitigation and preparedness measures for enhanced capability to reduce the adverse impact of disasters. The major activities undertaken within this  scheme include the setting  up of  the  National  Centre  for Disaster  Management  (NCDM)  at  the  Indian  Institute  of  Public  Administration, creation of 24 disaster management faculties in 23 states, research and consultancy services, documentation of major disaster events and forging regional cooperation. The Eighth Plan allocation of Rs 6.30 crore for this scheme was increased to Rs. 16.32 crore in the Ninth Plan. Within this scheme, NCDM has conducted over 50 training programmes,  training more  than 1000  people, while 24 disaster management  centres  with  dedicated  faculty  have  been  established  in  the  states. Over 4000 people have been trained at the State level. In addition, some important publications and audio-visual training modules have been prepared and documentation of disaster events has been done.
- 43. Though limited in scope and outlays, the Scheme has made an impact on the training and research activities in the country. Creation of faculties in disaster management  in  all  28  states  is  proposed  to  be  taken  up  in  the  Tenth  Plan  in addition to community mobilisation, human resource development, establishment of Control Rooms and forging international cooperation in disaster management.

There is also an urgent need for strengthening the disaster management pedagogy by  creating  disaster  management  faculties  in  universities,  rural  development institutes and other organisations of premier research.

- 44. Sustainability  is  the  key  word  in  the  development  process.  Development activities that do not consider the disaster loss perspective fail to be sustainable. The compounded costs of disasters relating to loss of life, loss of assets, economic activities, and cost of reconstruction of not only assets but of lives can scarcely be borne  by  any  community  or  nation.  Therefore,  all  development  schemes  in vulnerable  areas  should  include  a  disaster  mitigation  analysis,  whereby  the feasibility of a project is assessed with respect to vulnerability of the area and the mitigation measures required for sustainability. Environmental protection, afforestation  programmes,  pollution  control,  construction  of  earthquake  resistant structures etc., should therefore have high priority within the plans.
- 45. The aim of a mitigation strategy is to reduce losses in the event of a future occurrence  of  a  hazard.  Structural  mitigation  may  comprise  construction  of individual disaster resistant structures like retrofitted or earthquake-resistant buildings or creation of structures whose function is primarily disaster protection like flood control

structures, dykes, levees, infiltration dams etc.

- 46. Mitigation  measures  on  individual  structures  can  be  achieved  by  design standards, building codes and performance specifications. Building codes, critical front-line defence for achieving  stronger engineered structures, need to be drawn up  in  accordance  with  the  vulnerability  of  the  area  and  implemented  through appropriate techno-legal measures.
- 47. Mitigation measures need to be considered in land use and site planning activities.  Constructions in hazardous areas like flood plains or steep soft slopes are more vulnerable to disasters. Necessary mitigation measures need to be built into the design and costing of development projects.
- 48. Insurance  is  a  potentially  important  mitigation  measure  in  disaster-prone areas  as  it  brings  quality  in  the  infrastructure  &amp;  consciousness  and  a  culture  of safety  by  its  insistence  on  following  building  codes,  norms,  guidelines,  quality materials in construction etc. Disaster insurance mostly works under the premise of 'higher the risk higher the premium, lesser the risk lesser the premium', thus creating  awareness  towards  vulnerable  areas  and  motivating  people  to  settle  in relatively safer areas.

## THE PATH AHEAD

- 49. For addressing natural calamities such as floods and drought, there already exist a number of plan schemes under which a lot is being done and can be done. State Governments need to make full use of the existing plan schemes and give priority  to  implementation  of  such  schemes  that  will  help  in  overcoming  the conditions created by the calamity. In some cases this implies possible diversion of  the  funds  from  other  schemes  to  those  schemes  the  implementation  of  which will  help  meeting  the  situation.  There  may  also  be  need  in  a  crisis  situation  for certain re-appropriations/reallocations among the different departments.
- 50. The Planning Commission will aim at responding quickly to the needs of the  Central  Ministries/Departments/States  in  matters  relating  to  the  Plan  for meeting  situations  arising  out  of  natural  disasters,  by  enabling  adjustment  of schemes to meet the requirements as far as possible. A mechanism will be evolved to  take  expeditious  decisions  on  proposals  which  involve  transfer  of  funds  from one  scheme  to  another,  or  any  other  change  which  involves  departure  from  the existing schemes/

pattern of assistance, new schemes and relaxation in procedures, etc. in the case of natural disasters.

- 51. As the first responder in any disaster situation, however, each State needs to  build  a  team  ,  skilled  personnel,  make  provision  for  specialised  equipments, efficient  communication  network,  and  relevant,  intelligent  and  easily  accessible database. There is also a need to consider creation of a plan scheme in each state basically  to  meet  the  minimum  requirements  for  strengthening  communications and  emergency  control  rooms,  thereby  improving  coordination  and  response  to disasters. No new institutional structures need be created in such a scheme.
- 52. In particular, with regard to major disasters, it is also necessary for disaster mitigation components to be built into all development projects. In order to save larger  outlays  on  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  subsequently,  a  mechanism would need  to  be  worked  out  for  allowing  components  that  specifically  help  projects coming up in highly disaster prone areas withstand the impact of natural disasters as part of approved project cost for projects financed under the Plan.
- 53. The  message  for  the  Tenth  Plan  is  that  in  order  to  move  towards  safer national development, development projects should be sensitive towards disaster mitigation. With the kind of economic losses and developmental setbacks that the country has been suffering year after year, it makes good economic sense to spend a  little  extra  today  in  a  planned  way  on  steps  and  components  that  can  help  in prevention  and  mitigation  of  disasters,  than  be  forced  to  spend  many  multiples

more later on restoration and rehabilitation. The design of development projects and the process of development should take the aspect of disaster reduction and mitigation  within  its  ambit;  otherwise,  the  development  ceases  to  be  sustainable and eventually causes more hardship and loss to the nation.

## GUIDELINES TO STATE GOVERNMENTS

- (i) The  State  Department  of  Relief  and  Rehabilitation  may  be  converted into  Department  of  Disaster  Management  with  the  responsibility  of looking at the whole cycle of disaster management-  prevention, mitigation,  preparedness,  response,  relief  and  rehabilitation.  Steps  for prevention/mitigation will need to be taken across a number  of Departments.  The Department of Disaster Management will coordinate the steps taken by the different Department of the Government in these spheres.
- (ii) Mitigation, preparedness and response are multi-disciplinary activities involving  a  number  of  Departments.  In  order  to  ensure  the  fullest involvement  of  the  relevant  Departments,  the  State  Government  may consider  setting  up  a  State  Disaster  Management  Authority  under  the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary with the Secretaries of Departments of Water Resources, Health, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Roads, Communications, Rural Development, Public Works,  Public  Health  Engineering,  Finance  and  Home  as  Members. The Secretary of the Department of Disaster Management may be the member-Secretary.  This authority will ensure coordinated steps towards mitigation  and  preparedness  as  also  coordinated  response  when  a disaster strikes.
- (iii) It has been noticed that while the local administration has the requisite skills  and  capabilities  for  carrying  out  search  and  rescue  in  recurrent types of disaster  like  flood,  there  is  lack  of  capability  for    specialised search  and  rescue.    Each  State  may  consider  setting  up  specialised search and rescue teams.    The teams would need to be composite with one  coy  of  the  State  Armed  Police  trained  and  equipped  to  carry  out

specialised search and rescue; one mobile engineering unit with necessary  equipment  and  one  medical  assistance  team.    These  teams may be constituted and trained together so as to function as a unit under the  overall  charge  of  a  designated  officer.    Guidance/advise  required with  reference  to  training  and  equipment  will  be  provided  by  the Disaster Management  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs, Government of India.

- (iv) It  has  been  decided  that  fire  services  may  be  trained  and  equipped  to function  as  all  hazard  response  units  as  in  other  countries.    This  will necessitate some additional equipment and training to the fire units for carrying our search and rescue in all types of disasters. The Government of India will be initiating a separate project for this.
- (v) The Ministry of Home Affairs had advised the State Governments that composite  control  rooms  may  be  set  up  at  the  State  level  and  at  the district  levels  under  the  District  Magistrates  for  coordinating  law  and order  as  well  as  disaster  management  and  that  allocations  under  the Modernisation  of  Police  Forces  Schemes  may  be  used  for  the  this purpose.  Steps may be taken to put such control room in place quickly with standby communication systems.
- (vi) Disaster mitigation concerns/ aspects may be made an essential term of reference  for  every  plan  project/development  scheme  in  the  areas vulnerable to disasters.  In other words, every plan project will need to state as to how  is  addresses  mitigation concerns. Plans/projects specifically addressing mitigation/ prevention may be given a priority. The Secretary of Department of Disaster Management may be made a member  for  all  bodies/  teams  constituted  for  scrutinizing/approving projects/plans.

- (vii) Funds available under the ongoing schemes may be used for mitigation/ preparedness. For example funds under the rural development scheme can be used for construction of cycle shelters in areas prone to cyclones. Similarly, sites and designs of primary school buildings in flood prone areas may be so selected so that they can serve as shelters in times of floods.    The  design  requirements  for  primary  school  building  and hospitals and other important public buildings in seismic zones V and IV would need to be in accordance with BIS norms for construction in these zones.
- (viii) Every hazard prone district may draw up specific hazard related plans. These plans may be reviewed/updated in the months of April and May each year.
- (ix) Every district located in area prone to hazard will need to maintain an on line inventory of resources available in the Government, public and private sector. This  will enable  easy  and  quick  mobilization  of resources  in  case  of  need.    A  State-wide  on  line  resources  inventory would enable the mobilization of resources from neighbouring districts in cases of need.
- (x) State in seismic zone V and IV may ensure that the BIS building codes for  these  zones  have  been  adopted  and  are  rigorously  enforced  by  the municipal bodies.  All construction in the Government sector in these areas must conform to the BIS code.
- (xi) The initial  training  curriculum  of  the  field  staff-  VLWs,  Karamcharis, Patwaris, Talhatis, Block Agriculture Officers, Block Animal Husbandry  Officers other Block Supervisors, State Civil Service Officers, Constables, Sub-inspectors, Dy S.Ps etc. in the States vulnerable to hazards may include capsules on basic dos and don'ts in case  of  disasters;  disaster  mitigation  and  response,  search  and  rescues

techniques etc.  In-service training may be organized for staff already in service.

- (xii) Special efforts may be put in for education and awareness.  This should include awareness of basic design requirements for constructing private housing in seismic zones IV and V as well as in the belt vulnerable to cyclones.
- (xiii) AICTE  have  been  advised  to  include  engineering  aspects  of  disaster mitigation in the engineering courses at the undergraduate level.  State Governments  may  take  similar  action  with  reference  to  engineering colleges under their universities.
- (xiv) CBSE have been  advised  to  include  basic  disaster  related  material  in text  books  for  classes  8 th ,  9 th and  10 th -  the  basic  dos  and  don'ts  / precaution  to be  taken  etc. State Government  may  advise  their Secondary Boards of Education to include similar in their text books.

## DISASTER MANAGEMENT

## EXISTING FRAMEWORK AND NEW INITIATIVES

## Existing Framework

In  the  federal  set  up  of  India,  the  basic  responsibility  for  undertaking rescue, relief and rehabilitation measures in the event of a disaster is that of the State Government concerned. The Central Government supplements the efforts of State  Governments  by  providing  financial  and  logistic  support  in  case  of  major disasters.    At  the  State  level,  response,  relief  and  rehabilitation  are  handled  by Departments of Relief &amp; Rehabilitation.  The State Crisis Management Committee is set up under the Chairmanship of Chief Secretary who is the highest executive functionary in the State.  All the concerned Departments and organisations of the State and Central Government Departments located in the State are represented in this Committee.  This Committee reviews the action taken for response and relief and gives guidelines/directions as necessary.

- 2. A control room is established under the Relief Commissioner.  The control room  is  in  constant  touch  with  the  climate  monitoring/forecasting  agencies  and monitors the action being taken by various agencies in performing their responsibilities.
- 3. The  district  level  is  the  key  level  for  disaster  management  and  relief activities. The  District  Magistrate/Collector/Dy.  Commissioner  is  the  chief administrator  in  the  district.    He  is  the  focal  point  in  the  preparation  of  district plans  and  in  directing,  supervising  and  monitoring  calamity  relief.    A  District Level  Coordination  and  Relief  Committee  is  constituted  and  is  headed  by  the Collector as Chairman with the participation of all other related government and non governmental agencies and departments in addition to the elected representatives. The Collector is required to maintain close liaison with the State Government  as  well as the nearest units of Armed  Forces/Central police organisations and other relevant Central Government organisations like Ministries of  Communications,  Water  Resources,  Drinking  Water,  Surface  Transport,  who could supplement the efforts of the district administration in the rescue and relief operations.    The District Magistrate/Collector and the Coordination Committee under  him  reviews  preparedness  measures  prior  to  an  impending  hazard  and coordinates  response  when  the  hazard  strikes.      As  all  the  Departments  at  the district level report to the Collector, there is an effective coordination mechanism ensuring holistic response.
- 4. Each State Government has relief manuals/codes which identify the role of each  Department  in  the  State  for  managing  the  natural  disasters.  These  are

reviewed  and  updated  periodically  based  on  the  experience  of  managing  the disasters and the need of the State.

## Funding mechanisms

- 5. The policy and the funding mechanism for provision of relief assistance to those affected by natural calamities is clearly laid down.  These are reviewed by the Finance Commission appointed by the Government of India every five years. The  Finance  Commission  makes  recommendation  regarding  the  division  of  tax and  non-tax  revenues  between  the  Central  and  the  State  Governments  and  also regarding  policy  for  provision  of  relief  assistance  and  the  share  of  expenditure thereon.  A Calamity Relief Fund (CRF) has been set up in each State as per the recommendations of the Eleventh Finance Commission.  The size of the Calamity Relief Fund has been fixed by the Finance Commission after taking into account the expenditure  on  relief and  rehabilitation over  the past 10  years. The Government of India contributes 75% of the corpus of the Calamity Relief Fund in each  State.    25%  is  contributed  by  the  State.    The  requirement  of  funds  for response and relief is met from the CRF. Overall norms for relief assistance are laid  down  by  a  national  committee  with  representatives  of  States  as  members. Different States can have State-specific norms to be recommended by State level committee under the Chief Secretary.  Where the calamity is of such proportion that the funds available in the CRF will not be sufficient for provision of relief, the State  seeks  assistance  from  the  National  Calamity  Contingency  Fund  (NCCF). When such requests are received, the requirements are assessed by a team from the Central  Government  and  thereafter  the  assessed  requirements  are  assessed  by  a Central team and thereafter the requirements are placed before an Inter Ministerial Group chaired by the Home Secretary. A High Level Committee chaired by the Home Minister with the Agriculture  Minister,  Finance  Minister  and  the  Deputy Chairman Planning Commission take decision regarding the release of assistance from the NCCF based on the report of the Central Team and the recommendations of  the  IMG  thereon.      In  brief,  the  institutional  arrangements  for  response  and relief are well established and have proved to be robust and effective.

## Role of Central Government

- National Disaster Management Division/MHA/GOI/28/06/2004 6. At the national level, the Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal Ministry for all matters concerning disaster management except drought, which continues to be handled by the Ministry of Agriculture.   The Central Relief Commissioner (CRC) in  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  is  the  nodal  officer  for  coordinating  relief assistance for the natural and manmade disasters. The CRC receives information relating  to  forecasting/warning  of  a  natural  calamity  from  India  Meteorological Department  (IMD)  or  from  Central  Water  Commission  of  Ministry  of  Water Resources on a continuing basis. These forecasts are also concurrently passed on to the State by the Agencies responsible for early warning. Whenever assistance is required by the States for handling a natural calamity, the assistance is coordinated by  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs.  Nodal  Officers  have  been  appointed  in  each Ministry/Department responsible for emergency support functions in the event of a

disaster. The Central Relief Commissioner coordinates with the Nodal Officers to ensure that the requisite assistance is made available to the State.

## Transfer of Subject

- 7. The  subject  of  disaster  management  (except  drought  and  epidemics)  was transferred  to  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in 2002.    The  change  in  the  Government  of  India  (Allocation  of  Business)  Rules, 1961 was made in February, 2002.  The actual transfer of work took place only in June, 2002.

## Change in Orientation

- 8. Prior to the transfer, the focus had been entirely on post disaster relief and rehabilitation. Very little, if any, attention was paid to mitigation and preparedness. We  have  brought  about  a  radical  change  in  orientation  emphasizing mitigation, prevention and preparedness. A strategic framework/roadmap has been drawn up with the  approval  of  former  Dy.  Prime Minister and action is being taken as per the roadmap.  A copy of the roadmap is at Annexure-I.

## National Policy on Disaster Management

- 9 Despite  the  fact  that  we  lose  thousands  of  lives  and  property  worth thousands of crores each year in disasters, we have not had a National Policy on Disaster Management.  Where a number of Ministries or where a broad segment of Government is involved; it is  useful  to  have  a  National  Policy  as  it  serves  as  a framework  for  action  by  all  the  relevant  Ministries/Departments.    A  National Policy on Disaster Management has been drafted.    In line with the changed focus, the policy proposes to integrate disaster mitigation into developmental planning.

## Institutional Changes

- 10. The primary objective is to change the focus from relief and rehabilitation to  mitigation  and  preparedness.    MHA  is  working  towards  putting  in  place institutions which will reflect this holistic approach.  The States have been advised (HS had written to all Chief Secretaries and the former Dy. Prime Minister has also written to all Chief Ministers in this regard) to convert their Departments of Relief &amp; Rehabilitation into Department of Disaster Management.  10 States/UTs Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan Tamil Nadu, Uttaranchal, Nagaland, Andaman &amp; Nicobar Administration and Lakshadweep have already acted on this.
- National Disaster Management Division/MHA/GOI/28/06/2004 11. The exercise of reducing vulnerabilities of mitigation or of preparedness or in fact of response is multi-disciplinary. It involves a number of

Ministries/Departments.    Unfortunately,  till  date  all  Departments  have  had  the feeling that disaster management/response is the responsibility of the Department of Relief and Rehabilitation alone.  The States have, therefore, been advised to set up Disaster Management Authorities under the Chief Minister with the Ministers of Water Resources, Agriculture, Home, Health, PWD, Animal Husbandry, Urban Development and other Ministers who may be relevant as members.  11 States and UTs  -  Tamil  Nadu,  Arunachal  Pradesh,  Uttaranchal,  Orissa,  Gujarat,  Kerala, Nagaland, Delhi, Goa, A&amp;N administration and Chandigarh Administration have notified  the  authority.  The  other  States  are  in  the  process  of  setting  up  similar authorities.

- 12. At the National level, a National Emergency Management Agency is being set up.  The proposal for setting up NEMA and building up specialised capabilities was considered by the Committee of Secretaries (COS) on 21 st April, 2004. Based on  the  recommendations  of  the  COS,  the  Note  for  the  Empowered  Group  of Ministers  on  Disaster  Management  is  being  revised  for  submission  to  Home Minister for approval.

## Disaster Management Codes

- 13. In line with the changed approach, we are converting the Relief Codes into Disaster Management Codes by building into it the process necessary for drawing up disaster management and mitigation plans as well as elements of preparedness apart  from  response  and  relief.    A  Committee  constituted  under  the  Executive Director, National institute of Disaster Management is expected to submit the draft to the Ministry by 30 th June, 2004.

## MITIGATION

## Twelfth Finance Commission

- 14. The terms of Reference of the Twelfth Finance Commission were changed from what it was for the Eleventh Finance Commission so as to cover mitigation. A  Memorandum  has  been  drawn  up  and  sent  to  the  Commission.    In  the Memorandum, we have proposed a Disaster Mitigation Fund of Rs.10,000 crores under which we will be assisting the States to take up mitigation projects.

## Core Group on Earthquake Mitigation

- 15.     A Core Group on Earthquake Mitigation has been set up having the most eminent authorities  on  earthquake  engineering  in  the  country  as  members.    The States in seismic zones III, IV and V have been advised  to change their building bye-laws to incorporate the BIS codes for safe construction in the seismic zones. Some States have done this already.  In order to help other States, a Committee has  been  set  up  to  draw  up  model  building  bye  laws  and  development  control regulation for adoption by the States/UTs.  The Committee is expected to submit its report to the Ministry by 15 th June, 2004.

- 16. Bureau  of  Indian  Standards  (BIS)  is  mandated  to  develop  national  codes and practices for design and construction of housing and all infrastructure projects. Structural safety of the built environment can be ensured only when these codes are  observed  in  design  and  construction  of  all  projects.  These  codes/documents need  to  be  revised  at  regular  intervals  based  on  change  in  hazard  zonation, building performance in past disasters and outcomes of research projects. It was observed that these codes are not revised periodically even though BIS is expected to do this once in every five years. A committee consisting of representatives of Ministry of Consumer Affairs, BIS and MHA   is being constituted to review the development of codes relevant to earthquake risk mitigation and the protocol for revision by BIS. Availability to these codes in different parts of the country is also an  issue  as  was  observed  in  the  studies  post  Latur[1993]  and  Kachhh[2001] earthquakes.  BIS  has  been  advised  to  develop  a  plan  of  action  to  streamline revision  of  existing  codes,    development  of  new  codes/documents/commentaries and  availability  of  codes  all  over  the  country  including  on-line  access  to  codes related to earthquake risk reduction.

## Training of Engineers/Architects/Masons in Seismically safe building design and construction

- 17. It  has  been  observed  that  even  where  bye-laws  have  been  amended  to incorporate the BIS codes, these are not being implemented.  The reason is that the engineers/architects  practising  in  private  sector  are  not  trained  in  the  relevant codes and neither are the engineers in the regulatory bodies (the municipality/development authority).  A project costing about Rs.12.36 crore has been approved wherein the municipal engineers of all cities in the seismic zones will  be  trained  in  the  BIS  codes  as  well  as  revised  bye-laws,  and    Certificate courses  will  be  organised    for  engineers    practising  in  the  private  sector.  11 National  Resource  Institutes  have  been  selected  for  imparting  training  to  the Faculty members of Civil Engineering Departments of State Resource Institutes. State Governments are in the process of nominating the State Resource Institutes (Engineering  Colleges)  and  the  Faculty  Members  to  be  trained.  A  six-week training module has been finalized for this purpose. The State Resource Institutes will  train  10,000  engineers  throughout  the  country  in  safe  earthquake  resistant constructions. They will also assist the State Governments in putting in place an appropriate techno-legal regime, in developing appropriate IEC materials, and in conducting the detailed evaluation of lifeline buildings and make recommendations  for  retro-fitting,  where  necessary.  A  copy  of  the  approved programme for capacity building of engineers in earthquake risk management is at Annexure-II. A  similar  programme  for  training  of  10,000  architects  in conjunction with Indian Institute of Architects/Council of Architecture has been formulated and is under submission for approval.
- National Disaster Management Division/MHA/GOI/28/06/2004 18.    Masons  play  an  important  role  in  construction  of  buildings  and  critical infrastructure. For most of the rural and many urban constructions, mason is the architect, engineer and builder. There is no formal system of training of masons in construction  of  multi-hazard  resistant  built  environment.  A  programme  to  assist

the States/UTs in training and certification of 30000 masons in consultation with HUDCO and MORD is under formulation.  The training module for masons to include  multi-hazard  resistant  construction  is  under  preparation  by  a  committee constituted  and  revised  curriculum  will  be  a  part  of  the  vocational  training programme of MHRD.

## Awareness Campaign

- 19. This in itself will not be sufficient unless the people living in the seismic zones are also made aware of their vulnerability as well as the means of reducing that  vulnerability.      A  nation-wide  media  campaign  is  proposed.    The  Home Secretary had taken a meeting with the Secretary (I&amp;B), DG, Doordarshan, and DG, DAVP to discuss this.  In pursuance of this meeting, a Steering Committee was set up under the Chairmanship of Secretary (BM) to consider the matter in detail.    The  Prasar  Bharti  proposed  to  the  Steering  Committee  that  they  may  be given  an  opportunity  to  draw  up  the  media  plan.  Prasar  Bharti  have  made  a presentation submitted a plan/proposal on the media campaign.   The matter will be considered further by the Steering Committee in its next meeting scheduled to be held shortly.

## Earthquake Engineering in Undergraduate Engineering Curricula

- 20. Up till  now,  earthquake  engineering  was  not  a  part  of  the  undergraduate engineering curriculum which was the reason for the structural engineers not being aware  of  the  elements  necessary  for  earthquake  resistant  construction.    A  draft curriculum has been finalized for incorporation in the undergraduate engineering courses to be introduced from the current academic year. A similar curriculum has been  finalized  for  architects,  to  be  introduced  in  the  Schools  of  Planning  and Architecture.

## Awareness Generation for safe construction in rural areas

- 21 For the rural areas, where people go for non-engineered construction, the strategy  is  of  awareness  generation  by  distribution  of  pamphlets  bringing  out essential features, which need to be incorporated into the construction so that it is safe;  and  of  training  the  masons.    Samples  of  pamphlets/posters which could be circulated  have  been  compiled,  and  have  been  made  available  to  States  for adoption/translation into local languages.

## Retro-fitting of lifeline buildings

- National Disaster Management Division/MHA/GOI/28/06/2004 22. The above measures will take care of the future building stock.  Insofar as existing building stock is concerned, these will need retrofitting.  Since it is not possible  to  retrofit  all  the  buildings,  the  focus  is  on  life  line  buildings/buildings where people congregate -hospitals, schools, cinema halls, multi-storied complexes etc.  The Home Secretary has written to the Chairman, Railway Board, Health Secretary, Secretary(Civil Aviation), Secretary (Power) and Secretary(Telecom)  requesting  them  to  have  the  railway  stations,  hospitals  and airports/airport control towers, power stations and telecommunication installations located in the seismic zone, examined to see whether they need retrofitting, and, if so, to take action accordingly.  They have also been requested to ensure that future

construction  in  the  seismic  zones  incorporate  the  features  essential  for  safe construction as per the BIS code for that zone.

## Earthquake Risk Mitigation Project

- 23. An Earthquake  Mitigation  Project  has  been  drawn  up,  with  an  estimated cost of Rs.1039 crore.  That project has been given in-principle clearance by the Planning Commission.  The project is being submitted for in principle approval of Home Minister. Thereafter, the project will be appraised by the Committee on Non Plan Expenditure (CNE) before it is submitted for the approval of the Cabinet.

## Urban Earthquake Vulnerability Reduction

- 24. Pending  the  clearance  of  the  larger  project,  a  project  for  earthquake mitigation  in  38  identified  cities  which  are  in  seismic  zones  III,  IV  and  V  and which have a population of more than half a million as well as in other cities/areas covered  under  the  GOI-UNDP  project  in  169  districts  in  17  multi-hazard  prone States  has  been  taken  up.    118  Orientation  courses  have  been  organized  for engineers and architects on the BIS codes for seismically safe construction in 38 cities.    Awareness  generation  programme has been started in these cities. These cities  are  also  being  assisted  to  change  their  building  bye-laws.  City  Disaster Management Plans are being developed under the project.

## Cyclone Monitoring and Mitigation Group

- 25. A Cyclone Monitoring and Mitigation Group has been set up.  This Group is  looking  at  protocols  for  cyclone  warning  and  also  the  observation/monitoring platform  which  need  to  be  strengthened.    A  project  has  been  taken  up  with  the United States for upgradation of models for cyclone track prediction.

## Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project

- 26. A project for Cyclone Mitigation (estimated cost Rs.1050 crore) has been drawn up in consultation with the cyclone prone States.  This project envisages construction of cyclone shelters, coastal shelter belt plantation in areas which are prone to storm surges, strengthening of warning systems, training and education etc.    This  project  has  also  been  given  in-principle  clearance    by  the  Planning Commission and the World Bank has agreed in principle to provide funding  for the project. The project has been posed to the World Bank through Department of Economic  Affairs.  Counter-part  funding  will  have  to  be  provided  in  the  plan budget.

## GOI-UNDP Disaster Risk Management Project

- National Disaster Management Division/MHA/GOI/28/06/2004 27. 169  districts  in  seventeen  multi-hazard  prone  States  have  been  taken  up under the GOI-UNDP project.  Under this project, the States are being assisted to draw  up  State,  district  and  Block  disaster  management  plans;    village  disaster management  plans  are  being  developed  in  conjunction  with  the  Panchayati  Raj Institutions  and    disaster  management  teams  consisting  of  village  volunteers  are being trained in various preparedness and response functions such as search and rescue, first aid, relief coordination, shelter management etc.    Equipment needs

8

for  district  and  State  Emergency  Operation  Centres  have  been  identified  by  the State nodal agencies and equipment is being provided to these EOCs.  Orientation training of masons, engineers and architects in disaster resistant technology have been initiated in these districts and construction of model demonstration buildings will  be  started  soon.    A  statement  showing  the  achievements  under  the  DRM programme from September, 2002 to March, 2004 is at Annexure III.

## Mainstreaming Mitigation in Rural Development Schemes

28. The  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  is  working  with  the  Ministry  of  Rural Development  for  changing  the  guidelines  so  that  the  houses  constructed  under IAY  or  school  buildings/community  buildings  constructed  under  SGRY  are earthquake/cyclone/flood resistant; as also that the schemes addressing mitigation are given priority under SGRY.  Ministry of Rural Development are carrying out an  exercise  for  this  purpose.  The  matter  is  being  closely  followed  up  with  that Ministry.

## NE States and A&amp;N Islands

- 29. A special focus is being given to North-Eastern States and the Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands.  The North-Eastern Council has been made the nodal agency for the  NE  States.  The  NEC  has  been  provided  with  a  resource  person/advisor  in disaster  management.    A  detailed  presentation  on  the  vulnerabilities  of  the  NE region and the need for comprehensive disaster management plan was given to the Governor of Assam and Chairman, NEC.  An action plan has been drawn up by NEC, which has been discussed in the Governing Body meeting of the NEC and a declaration namely 'Shillong Declaration' has been adopted by all States in the NE region for integrating disaster management with development planning.   140 officials  and  non-officials    have  been  trained  in  disaster  management  to  act  as resource persons for the NE region.
- 30. For A&amp;N Islands, a disaster management plan has been drawn up.  This plan was discussed in a meeting on the 16 th of  October, 2003 and cleared. Draft Disaster Management Regulations for A&amp;N Islands have also been vetted.

## PREPAREDNESS

## Specialist Response Teams

- 31. Eight  battalions  of  CPMFs  are  being  converted  into  specialist  response teams for responding to emergencies/disasters as well.  Two training institutions CISF/ NISA, Hyderabad and the ITBP/BTC, Bhanu (near Chandigarh) have been developed as nodal institutions for training the trainers as well as the teams.  The training  centres  of  CRPF(CTC-II  at  Coimbatore)  and  BSF  Academy,  Tekanpur have  also  been  identified  to  impart  such  training  to  the  teams  from  CRPF  and BSF.  16 teams have already been trained at NISA, Hyderabad and BTC, Bhanu and  training of more teams is continuing. Training of trainers of CRPF and BSF will be conducted at NISA, Hyderabad in June and September, 2004 respectively.

## National Emergency Response Force

- 32. It is proposed to constitute these eight battalions into a special Force called the  National  Emergency  Response  Force  (NERF).  The  elements  which  need financial  sanction  have  already  been  included  in  the  Note  for  the  Empowered Group of Ministers on Disaster Management.
- 33. The States have also been advised to set up their own specialist teams for responding to disasters.  They have been advised that we will provide assistance for  training  of  trainers.    Resources  have  been  an  important  constraint  for  the States.    We  have,  therefore,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  Finance  Ministry, provided  that  10%  of  the  annual  inflows  into  the  CRF  can  be  used  for  the procurement of search and rescue equipment and communication equipment.
- 34. Apart from the eight battalions  which are being developed into specialist units, it was decided  that all the CPMFs should have the basic expertise in search and  rescue  so  that  they  can  be  requisitioned  for  search  and  rescue  by  the States/District  Administration.    A  curriculum  for  this  has  been  drawn  up  and integrated  into the training curricula of the CPMFs.

## Fire Services as Multi-hazard Response Units

- 35. In order to further strengthen our capacity for response, the fire services are proposed to be developed into multi-hazard response units (as is the practice in other countries).  This will require additional equipment and training.  A project for  this  (with  an  estimated  cost  of  Rs.2457  crore)  has  been  drawn  up.    The Planning Commission has given in-principle clearance to the project.  The project is  being  submitted  for  in-principle  approval  of  Home  Minister.  A  Note  for  the Committee on Non Plan Expenditure is being finalized.

## Regional Response Centres

36. Regional Response Centres are being set up.  Fourteen Regional Response Centres have been identified - these are  Group Centres or battalion headquarters where a cache of essential search and rescue equipments will be stored so that they can respond to any disaster in the neighbouring States immediately.  Proposals for the cache of equipments are under consideration of Finance.

## Emergency Operations Centres

- 37. The States are being assisted to set up control rooms/emergency operations centres at the State and district level.  Assistance for this is being given under the GOI - UNDP project in the States covered by the project. Assistance under the Modernisation of Police Scheme is also available for setting up EOCs.
- National Disaster Management Division/MHA/GOI/28/06/2004 38. The  MHA  Control  Room  has  been  strengthened  with  some  additional equipment - SATPHONES and GPS and staff  trained in their operation.  A state

of  the  art  National  EOC  with  superior  structural  features  and  communication facilities is proposed to be set up. A Committee of CPWD/BARC/DRDO has been constituted  to  finalize  the  design  parameters.  The  project  will  be  executed  by CPWD and is scheduled to be completed by June, 2006.

## Communication System

- 39. The communication network between the national and the state EOCs and the  site  of  the  emergency/crises  is  currently  based  on  the  DOT  network.  It  has been observed that in a calamity/hazard, communication is the first casualty. It is therefore  decided  to  put  in  place  multi-mode  and  multi-channel  communication systems  so  that  enough  redundancy  is  available.  It  has  been  decided  that  the POLNET will also be used for disaster  management; and for  this  the  POLNET communication facility will be extended to SDMs and Collectors as well as the Emergency Operation Centers.  For emergency communications, discussions have also  been  held  with  the  Department  of  Space  (ISRO).    They  will  be  making available alternate satellite communication units to connect with State EOCs and mobile units which can be transported to the site of a disaster.  A Group had been set up for drawing up a communication plan for disaster management and the said Group  has  submitted  its  report.    This  provides  for  a  dedicated  communication system  for  disaster  management  with  built  in  redundancies.    Phase  I  of  the National  Disaster  Management  Communication  Plan  to  provide  satellite  based mobile  voice/data/video      communication  between  National  EOC/State  EOCs/ mobile EOCs and remote disaster/emergency sites is under implementation and is expected to be completed by August, 2004. Phase II of the communication plan to connect National/State/District  EOCs  with disaster/emergency sites is proposed to  be  completed by March, 2006. The communication backbone to be used will include terrestrial link(DOT),  POLNET, NICNET, ISDN and SPACENET.

## India Disaster Resource Network (IDRN)

- 40. One major step towards strengthening of our response system has been the launch  of  India  Disaster  Resource  Network  (IDRN).    This  is  a  web  based inventory  of  all  specialist  equipment  required  for  emergency/disaster  response. This will give at the touch of a button the location of specific equipment/specialist resources  as  well  as  the  controlling  authority  for  that  resource  so  that  it  can  be mobilized  for  response  in  the  shortest  possible  time.    This  was  launched  on  1 st September, 2003.  This inventory already has about 66,000 records/entries from 534 districts in 29 States/UTs.

## Handling of Hazardous Materials

- 41. In the light of the experience of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, the Ministry of Home Affairs has been interacting with Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests and new  guidelines  have  been  sent  to  the  States  for  industries  handling  hazardous materials.  It has been prescribed that onsite and offsite disaster response plans for the  industries  dealing  with  hazardous  material    be  updated  in  consultation  with District Administration and that this may be rehearsed once every year.  It has also been  prescribed  that  these  industries  will  carry  out  awareness  campaign  for  the population  in  the  vicinity  regarding  the  dos/don'ts  in  case  of  any  accident involving hazardous material

National Disaster Management Division/MHA/GOI/28/06/2004

## Incident Command System

42. In  order  to  professionalize  the  response,  it  is  proposed  to  introduce  the Incident Command System in the country.  This system is in vogue in the United States  and  it  provides  for  specialist  Incident  Command  Teams  with  an  Incident Commander and officers  trained  in  different  aspects  of  Incident  Management  logistics, operations, planning, media management etc.  We are working with the US experts for training of officers in this system here.  The LBSNAA, Mussoorrie has  been  designated  as  the  mother  training  institution.    Three  programme  for training  of  trainers  has  so  far  been  held  at  LBSNAA. 42  officers-trainers  have been trained so far in basic and intermediate ICS course and 29 officers-trainers trained in planning module.

## Human Resource Development

- 43. In order to further professionalize our response, it was  decided to incorporate  elements  of  disaster  management  in  the  training  curriculum  of  All India Services (IAS, IPS and Indian Forest Service).  Curricula have been drawn up for this purpose and have been integrated into the training curriculum of these All India Services.

## Disaster Awareness in School Education

- 44. It  was  felt  that  making  disaster  awareness  a  part  of  school  curriculum would be an important step.  Disaster awareness/Dos and Don'ts have been made a part of classes - VIII and IX CBSE curricula.  It is proposed to incorporate the elements of disaster awareness/do and don'ts in the curriculum of class  X in the coming academic year.  The State Governments have been advised to take similar steps vis-à-vis their school boards.  We are working with the Council of Board of School  Education  (COBSE)  to  facilitate  inclusion  of  disaster  management  in public education in all 39 School Boards in the country.

## Hospital Preparedness for emergencies

- 45. Hospital  preparedness  is  crucial  to  any  disaster  response  system.  For  the purpose each hospital should have an emergency preparedness plan to deal with mass casualties and should be manned by trained health managers.  The existing curriculum for medical doctors does not include emergency health management. Therefore  capacity  building  through  in-service  training  of  the  current  heath managers  and  medical  personnel  in  handling  health  emergencies  is  extremely essential. At the same time, the future health managers must acquire these skills systematically  through  the  inclusion  of  health  emergency  management  in  the undergraduate and post graduate medical curricula. In consultation with Medical Council of India(MCI) Two committees have been constituted for preparation of curriculum for introduction of emergency health management in MBBS curriculum,  and  preparation  of  in-service  training  of  Hospital  Managers  and Professionals.  Rajiv  Gandhi  University  of  Health  Sciences  Karnataka  have  been identified as the lead national resource institution for the purpose.
- National Disaster Management Division/MHA/GOI/28/06/2004 46. While the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has issued instructions to the states to evaluate the structural integrity of existing health institutions in high

seismic zones and carry out the necessary retrofitting activities, it is also important to address the integrity of non-structural elements like essential medical equipment as part of hospital preparedness for emergencies. Handling non-structural issues in hospitals  would  be  both  part  of  the  envisaged  sensitization  and  training  of practicing engineers and architects as well as hospital managers and administrators.

## Transparency in Relief Operations

- 47. We are seeking to bring about  transparency in relief operations.  We have advised  the  State  Governments  that  whenever  relief  material  is  distributed  from CRF/NCCF, a list giving the details of the beneficiaries along with quantity/volume  of  relief  distributed  may  be  prepared  ward-wise  both  for  urban and rural areas and be made available to local representatives in Panchayats and Municipalities and should also be displayed there.   The consolidated list should also  be  maintained  at  the  Block  level/Taluka  Level  and  made  available  to  the general public on demand.

## Civil Defence

48. A Committee was constituted to review the set up of Civil Defence. The Committee  has  given  its  recommendation  based  on  which  draft  proposals  are being formulated. CNE Notes for upgradation of National Civil Defence College and  National  Fire  Service  College  are  also  under  process.  A  Cabinet  Note  for strengthening of Civil Defence Organisation is under preparation.

## Status Report

49. A  Status  Report  on  Disaster  Management  in  India  was  prepared  in February, 2004 for presentation and circulation in the World Congress on Natural Disaster  Mitigation.  The  Report  summarizes  various  initiatives  taken  by  the Ministry. A copy of the Status Report (Red Book) is enclosed.

A disaster is not bound by political, social, economic or geographic boundaries . When it occurs, it impacts all. Globally, there has been an increase in the number of natural disasters over the past few years . The impact of such calamity, however does not remain confined to its physical component but transcends beyond it and impacts the socio-economic conditions of affected persons and places .

India has been actively pursuing a paradigm shift in disaster management from a relief centric approach in the past to the current holistic one, encompassing all facets of disaster management. The understanding and approach to management of disaster , however, remain myopic   and need to be broadened A holistic approach needs to include events which may not be catastrophic and sudden, impacting large number of the people at one go, but may take a slow epidemic form with huge tolls over period of time, such as road accidents which result in maximum number of casualties: little or no attention is given to their prevention. approach to disaster management should consider that single death in any disaster is more than a loss of human life; it impacts the entire family and puts the environment around them under stress. Any

India has made strides in several areas towards strengthening the institutional mechanism; response capacities and the financial arrangement for different activities relating to disaster management. However, the recent earthquake and tsunami in   Japan (March 2011) is reminder   that despite the best preparedness and highest response standards, disasters remain challenge to humankind We are to demystify nature and which sometimes goes beyond the human imagination as evident from an earthquake on the coast of Japan leading to the tsunami resulting in major and cascading into the breakdown of nuclear facilities and eventually turning into a nuclear emergency. long grim its fury yet fires

The   challenge before is, therefore, to strive towards higher levels of understanding; efforts and response mechanisms. This in turn needs to be backed by better coordination among different central ministries, state governments, Panchayati Raj Institutions, academic institutions, the corporate sector, civil societies and citizens at large. Towards strengthening the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)   effort, the Government has set up working group in the Planning Commission to make more efficient the mainstreaming efforts of DRR activities in our next Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-2017).

would urge all the stakeholders to come together and work concertedly for reducing the disaster risk in the country and make India as safe as humanly possible.

## MESSAGE

Recognising the hazard and vulnerability   profile of the country;  the requirement for protecting lives and assets from disasters as well as to prevent   erosion of development gains attained over several years, the Government of India has been systematically like many other countries the focus was on response The shift to a holistic approach started with the preparation of the Vulnerability Atlas and constitution of the High Powered Committee in the late nineties. The Ministry of Home Affairs was entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating disaster management activities at the national level. Soon after, in 2003, a framework for addressing disaster management in holistic manner was conceptualised and outlined in the national   disaster   management   framework   prepared by MHA Subsequently , the National  Disaster Management Act (2005) was enacted and the National Disaster Management   Authority was established . Formation of similar structures by state governments at the state and district levels were made mandatory , and the National Disaster Management (2009) was announced Policy

Recognising that flawed development has aggravated various types of vulnerabilities , the need to consider disaster risk as a development problem was emphasized for the first time in the Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-2007). Certification of measures taken to ensure risk reduction and do no harm" approach under development projects is now required before securing approval of funds. The Government has also set up an expert group to identify measures required to reduce the existing risk as well as the measures required to avoid creating new risks .

Though states have amended development control regimes; the capacity to enforce the provisions in these instruments are not adequate Therefore,  greater importance on training large number of government and non-government functionaries as well as capacity development of the construction professionals is required. There are several practices in the country; and a variety of measures to promote such information and knowledge-sharing will have to be encouraged.  Additionally, issues of up-scaling will have to be addressed good

This document captures the measures undertaken and systems established for disaster management in the country. It also articulates the next steps required. hope the to promote collaborative efforts to reduce disaster risk in the country .

## PREFACE

The geo-climatic zone in which India is located, the land mass located in vulnerable areas with the physical, social, and economic vulnerability of people in high risk areas makes it one of the most disaster prone countries in the  world.  Floods, droughts, earthquakes, cyclones and landslides  are common hazards that India faces. Natural hazards affected nearly six per cent of the population and twenty four per cent of deaths in Asia caused by disasters occurred in India. Around two per cent of national GDP is lost because of these disasters. A study conducted by the World Bank in 2003 suggested that natural disasters are a major impediment on the of economic development in India. large along living have have Path

coordination of disaster management in the Government of India. Since early 2000, the government has been focusing on developing the capacities in the country for preparedness,   prevention and   mitigation with   developing  capacities for response. The need to eliminate the underlying vulnerabilities through systematic integration of disaster risk reduction in development programmes is actively pursued at the national and state levels. Achieving India s development and sustainable development are not possible unless we ensure that all developments are disaster resilient. This would entail   putting in place   legal   instruments, appropriate institutional arrangements , building capacities at all levels to carry out a variety of risk reduction measures and developing   appropriate tools and guidelines . along being goals

Against   this   backdrop,  theGovernment of   India has taken up several measures to support sub-national level structures both in the government and in nongovernment sector. This document tries to capture the existing structures and mechanisms as well as outlines some of the priority areas that need focus in the near future. We would make efforts to enrich our interventions based on the inputs from all DM practitioners .

## EOREWORD

India is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, losing about 2 per cent of the GDP on an average due to these disasters. Almost every part of the country falls in at least one natural hazard zone or other and the socio-economic vulnerabilities in these areas makes it difficult for the people to cope with the impact of these incidents without external support.

Realising the loss of lives and revenue, as well as the erosion of development gains as a result of natural disasters of varying degrees that occur every year, the Government of India has been an active participant in the international movement for disaster risk reduction: The country has also been making efforts to develop capacities through variety of enabling mechanisms for risk reduction, which includes community based initiatives. The speed of risk reduction measures needs to be accelerated as disasters could hit any time and unfortunately we do not have the luxury of preparing for it after the location of such events is known through various forecasting techniques.

Indian scientists have been working on potential impact scenarios of climate variability and changes in various   agro-climatic zones.  The uncertainties associated with the changes that are being experienced in various parts of the country remind us of the need to be prepared and to undertake robust risk reduction measures. The traditional approach of risk assessment factoring is not adequate. The Government of India has been facilitating the work of state governments through a variety of measures ranging from institutional structures, human resource development as well as structural mitigation measures The preparedness and mitigation measures need further effort at all levels of governance, including at the Panchayati Raj Institutions level.

This document captures some of these initiatives and more importantly some areas that need attention. The government alone cannot undertake these initiatives and even if it does, that is not enough because disaster risk reduction is the responsibility of every development partner. There is thus wait, s0 / would expect all to join hands and work with government to make the country safe flags

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The  perception  about  disaster  and  its  management  has  undergone  a  change  following the  enactment  of  the  Disaster  Management  Act,  2005.  The  de fi nition  of  disaster  is  now  all encompassing,  which  includes  not  only  the  events  emanating  from  natural  and  man-made causes, but even those events which are caused by accident or negligence. There was a long felt need to capture information about all such events occurring across the sectors and e ff orts made to mitigate them in the country and to collate them at one place in a global perspective. This book has been an e ff ort towards realising this thought. This book in the present format is the outcome of the in-house compilation and analysis of information relating to disasters and their management gathered from di ff erent sources (domestic as well as the UN and other such agencies).

All  the  three  Directors  in  the  Disaster  Management  Division,  namely  Shri  J.P .  Misra,  Shri  Dev Kumar and Shri Sanjay Agarwal have contributed inputs to this Book relating to their sectors. Support extended by Prof. Santosh Kumar, Shri R.K. Mall, former faculty and Shri Arun Sahdeo from NIDM have been very valuable in preparing an overview of the book. This book would have been impossible without the active support, suggestions and inputs of Dr. J. Radhakrishnan, Assistant Country Director (DM Unit), UNDP, New Delhi and the members of the UNDP Disaster Management Team including Shri Arvind Sinha, Consultant, UNDP. Support was extended by all the concerned ministries who provided the data that has been used in compiling this book.  We sincerely acknowledge the organisations and the individuals whose photographs, fi gures and tables have been used in the presentation of this book for highlighting the issues concerned.

While compiling disaster issues across the sectors, for the fi rst time, with substantial information pertaining to other nodal ministries dealing with the subject, the chances of errors creeping in, is not ruled out. There would always be scope of improvement in the accuracy of material and analysis of facts. It is, however, expected that in the days to come, on the base prepared, this will be further improved upon, following the suggestions received from the end users. In producing this document, the cooperation extended by colleagues from di ff erent ministries/ departments  and  Government  agencies  is  acknowledged.  Without  the  consistent  guidance and support extended by Shri G.K. Pillai, Union Home Secretary and Shri A.E. Ahmad, Secretary (Border Management) it would not have been possible to prepare this document.

## 1.1 Introduction

1.1.1 India's geo-climatic conditions as well as its high degree of socio-economic vulnerability, makes it one of the most disaster prone country in the world. A disaster is an extreme disruption of the functioning of a society that causes widespread human, material, or environmental losses that  exceed  the  ability  of  the  a ff ected  society  to  cope  with  its  own  resources.    Disasters  are sometimes classi fi ed according to whether they are 'natural' disasters, or 'human-made' disasters. For example, disasters caused by fl oods, droughts, tidal waves and earth tremors are generally considered 'natural disasters.'  Disasters caused by chemical or industrial accidents, environmental pollution,  transport  accidents  and  political  unrest  are  classi fi ed  as 'human-made'  or 'humaninduced' disasters since they are the direct result of human action.

- 1.1.2 A more modern and social understanding of disasters, however, views this distinction as arti fi cial since most disasters result from the action or inaction of people and their social and economic structures. This happens by people living in ways that degrade their environment, developing  and  over  populating  urban  centres,  or  creating  and  perpetuating  social  and economic systems. Communities and population settled in areas susceptible to the impact of a raging river or the violent tremors of the earth are placed in situations of high vulnerability because of their socio-economic conditions. This is compounded by every aspect of nature being subject to seasonal, annual and sudden fl uctuations and also due to the unpredictability of the timing, frequency and magnitude of occurrence of the disasters.

## 1.2 Etymology

The word 'Disaster' derives from Middle French désastre 1 and that from Old Italian disastro , which in turn comes from the Greek pejorative pre fi x δυσ -, ( dus)  'bad'+ α στήρ ( aster ),  'star' . The root of the word disaster 2 ('bad star' in Greek and Latin) comes from an astrological theme in which the ancients used to refer to the destruction or deconstruction of a star as a disaster.

## 1.3 De fi nition

- 1.3.1 Disaster is an event or series of events, which gives rise to casualties and damage or loss of properties, infrastructures, environment, essential services or means of livelihood on such a scale which is beyond the normal capacity of the a ff ected community to cope with. Disaster is also sometimes described as a 'catastrophic situation in which the normal pattern of life or eco-system has been disrupted and extra-ordinary emergency interventions are required to save and preserve lives and or the environment' .

1.3.2 The Disaster Management Act, 2005 de fi nes disaster as 'a catastrophe, mishap, calamity or grave occurrence in any area, arising from natural or man made causes, or by accident or negligence which results in substantial loss of life or human su ff ering or damage to, and destruction of, property, or damage to, or degradation of, environment , and is of such a nature or magnitude as to be beyond the coping capacity of the community of the a ff ected area' .

1.3.3 The United Nations de fi nes disaster as 'the occurrence of sudden or major misfortune which disrupts the basic fabric and normal functioning of the society or community' .

## 1.4 Disasters not new to Mankind

1.4.1  Disasters  are  not  new  to  mankind. They  have  been  the  constant,  though  inconvenient, companions of the human beings since time immemorial. Disasters can be natural or humanmade.  Earthquake,  cyclone,  hailstorm,  cloud-burst,  landslide,  soil  erosion,  snow  avalanche,

fl ood etc. are the examples of natural disasters while fi re, epidemics, road, air, rail accidents and leakages of chemicals/ nuclear installations etc. fall under the category of human-made disasters. The High Power Committee on Disaster Management, constituted in 1999, has identi fi ed  31 various disasters categorized into fi ve major sub-groups which are given in Box 1.1.

## 1.5 Database

The mechanism for preparing a database for di ff erent kinds of disasters happening across the country is yet to be developed. National Institute for Disaster Management (NIDM), under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 has been tasked with research work and it is expected that it would develop a mechanism to capture such data on the disasters including its impact on socioeconomic life of the nation and GDP growth. At the global level, the three main sources which have been collecting the data are EM-DAT, Natcat and Sigma. EM-DAT is the acronym for data that the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology on Disasters (CRED) has been collecting from the

countries since 1987 (going back to 1900). Munich Reinsurance Company maintains Natcat and Swiss Reinsurance Company maintains Sigma. The authenticity of the data collected by these agencies varies and the fi gures given by them do not necessarily attest to any comprehensive data and may be exaggerated sometimes which was realized in the case of the report given in respect of 1999 landslides in Venezuela . 3

1.5.1 Lack of Central Statistical database as a record of past disasters is a major constraint for risk assessment and compilation of disaster history in the country. Di ff erent sources of data have di ff erent fi gures of casualties and impacts, thereby hindering an objective assessment. Scienti fi c data on major hazards are available but information on vulnerabilities are scattered in multiple places and often such data are not available uniformly for the entire country.

1.5.2 Disaster information available from di ff erent sources are yet to be regularly assessed by common public as well as other stakeholders. Lack of awareness about available resources is a reason for lack of last mile reach of the available information.

1.5.3 In India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation have taken initiatives for collection of data in respect of di ff erent disasters. A Technical Committee was constituted by the Central Statistics O ffi ce with a view to prepare a framework for disaster statistics for developing a database on disaster and related aspects. Five formats have been developed for capturing the information about (i) Statistics on disaster at district level, (ii) Statistics on relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction at district level, (iii) District wise compilation of statistics on disaster, (iv) Districtwise compilation of statistics on relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction and (v) Aggregation of damage and relief data at state level. The state Government and District level institutions would be required to furnish this information for preparing the data base at centralized level.

## 1.6. Disasters - Global Scenario 4

1.6.1 Disasters - natural or human-made are common throughout the world. Disasters continue to occur without warning and are perceived to be on an increase in their magnitude, complexity, frequency and economic impact. Hazards pose threats to people and assume serious proportions in  the  under  developed countries with dense population. During the second half of the 20 th century,  more  than  200  worst  natural  disasters  occurred  in  the  di ff erent  parts  of  the  world and claimed lives of around 1.4 million people.  Losses due to natural disasters are 20 times greater (as % of GDP) in the developing countries than in  industrialized one.  Asia tops the list of casualties due to natural disasters. Figure 1.1 shows the Regional distribution of disasters by type, as prepared by Centre for Research on Epidemiology of Disaster.

1.6.2 There have been several natural, as well as, man-made disasters. Records of natural disasters can be traced way back to 430 B.C. when the Typhus epidemic was reported in Athens. Ten deadliest natural disasters recorded in the world are dated back to 1556 when an earthquake in Shaanxi province of China occurred  on 23 rd January, 1556 and 8,30,000 casualties were recorded.

List of ten deadliest disasters which have occurred across the world and in India in the known history and in the last century may be seen from the Table 1.1 and Table 1.2 respectively.

## 1.7. Vulnerability Pro fi le of India

1.7.1  India  has  been  vulnerable,  in  varying  degrees,  to  a  large  number  of  natural,  as  well  as, human-made disasters on account of its unique geo-climatic and socio-economic conditions. It is highly vulnerable to fl oods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes, landslides, avalanches and forest fi res. Out of 35 states and union territories in the country, 27 of them are disaster prone. Almost 58.6 per cent of the landmass is prone to earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity; over 40 million hectares (12 per cent of land) are prone to fl oods and river erosion; of the 7,516 km long coastline, close to 5,700 km is prone to cyclones and tsunamis; 68 per cent of the cultivable area is vulnerable to drought and hilly areas are at risk from landslides and avalanches. A multi-hazard map of India may be seen in Figure 1.8.

## Hazard Pro fi le of India

- (a) India is one of the ten worst disaster prone countries of the world. The country is prone to disasters due to number of factors; both natural and human induced, including adverse geo climatic conditions, topographic features, environmental degradation, population growth, urbanisation, industrialization, non scienti fi c development practices etc. The factors either in  original  or  by  accelerating  the  intensity  and frequency of disasters are responsible for heavy toll of human lives and disrupting the life supporting system in the country.
- The basic reason for the high vulnerability of the country to natural disasters is its unique geographical and geological situations. As far as the vulnerability to disaster is concerned, the fi ve distinctive regions of the country i.e. Himalayan region, the alluvial plains, the hilly part of the peninsula, and the coastal zone have their own speci fi c problems. While on one hand the Himalayan region is prone to disasters like earthquakes and landslides, the plain is a ff ected by fl oods almost every year. The desert part of the country is a ff ected by droughts and famine while the coastal zone susceptible to cyclones and storms.
- (b) The natural geological setting of the country is the primary basic reason for its increased vulnerability.  The  geo-tectonic  features  of  the  Himalayan  region  and  adjacent  alluvial plains make the region susceptible to earthquakes, landslides, water erosion etc. Though peninsular India is considered to be the most stable portions, but occasional earthquakes in the region shows that geo- tectonic movements are still going on within its depth.
- (c) The  tectonic  features,  characteristics  of  the  Hiamalya  are  prevalent  in  the  alluvial  plains of  Indus,  Ganga and Brahmputra too, as the rocks lying below the alluvial pains are just extension  of  the  Himalayan  ranges  only. Thus  this  region  is  also  quite  prone  to  seismic activities. As a result of various major river systems fl owing from Himalaya and huge quantity of sediment brought by them, the area is also su ff ering from river channel siltation, resulting into frequent fl oods, especially in the plains of Uttar Pardesh and Bihar.
- (d) The western part of the country, including Rajasthan, Gujarat and some parts of Maharashtra are hit very frequently by drought situation. If Monsoon worsens the situation spreads in other parts of the country too.  The disturbance in the pressure conditions over oceans, results into cyclones in coastal regions. The geo tectonic movements going on in the ocean fl oor make the coastal region prone to tsunami disaster too.
- (e) The extreme weather conditions, huge quantity of ice and snow stored in the glaciers etc. are other natural factors which make the country prone to various forms  of disasters.
- (f ) Along  with  the  natural  factors  discussed  in  the  preceding  text,  various  human  induced activities  like  increasing  demographic  pressure,  deteriorating  environmental  conditions,

deforestation, unscienti fi c development, faulty agricultural practices and grazing, unplanned urbanisation,  construction  of  large  dams  on  river  channels  etc.  are  also  responsible  for accelerated impact and increase in frequency of disasters in the country.

Losses due to disasters have been shown in Figure 1.9. It shows that economic loss is accounted for 2% of the GDP due to disasters as per the study of the World Bank.

1.7.2 Vulnerability to disasters or emergencies of Chemical, Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) origin has increased on account of socio-economic development. Heightened vulnerabilities to  disaster  risks  can  be  related  to  expanding  population,  urbanization  and  industrialization, development within high-risk zones, environmental degradation and climate change.

During  the  last  two  decades  of  the  19th  century  (1982-2001),  natural  disasters  in  India  had claimed a total death toll of around 1, 07,813 people (on an average more than 5,390 death toll every year). As mentioned above, India with its extended coast line is exposed to fi ve to six tropical cyclones on an average, both from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal annually.

1.7.3 Climate Change: This is evident  from  the  increase  in  the global average air and ocean temperatures, precipitation and extreme rainfall, widespread melting of snow and ice, storms/ storm surges/coastal fl ooding and rising  global  mean  sea  level,  as recorded in the fourth Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC) Figure 1.10. Climate change is expected to increase the

## Disaster Management in India

frequency and intensity of current extreme weather events and give rise to new vulnerabilities with  di ff erential  spatial  and  socio-economic  impacts  on  communities.  The  unprecedented increase is expected to have severe impacts on the hydrological cycle, water resource, droughts, fl ood, drinking water, forest and ecosystems, sea level/coastal area losses of coastal wetlands and mangroves, food security, health and other related areas. The impact would be particularly disastrous for developing countries, including India and further degrade the resilience of poor, vulnerable communities, which make up between one quarter and one half of the population of the most Indian cities.

1.7.4 Reason  for  concern: There  is  clear  evidence  that  the  observed  change  in  surface temperature,  rainfall,  evaporation  and  extreme  events  and  climate  change  is  a  signi fi cant environmental challenge. The main impact of global climate change will be felt due to changes in climate variability and weather extremes. Observations during the last decade and projections indicate  that  extreme  events  i.e.  heat  waves,  cold  waves,  more fl oods,  more  droughts,  more intense cyclones and fl ash fl oods will increase. Extreme rainfall has substantially increased over large areas, particularly over the west coast and west central India. There is thus an urgent need for a paradigm shift in disaster management, especially under changing climate.

1.7.5 Poverty and disaster vulnerability: Poverty and risk to disasters are inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing.  The poor section of the society is worst a ff ected in case of disaster.  The situation further aggravates due to the compulsion of the poor to exploit environmental resources for their survival, increasing the risk and exposure of the society to disasters, in particular those triggered by fl ood, drought and landslides. Poverty also compels the poor to migrate and live at physically more vulnerable locations, often on unsafe land and in unsafe shelters. These inhabitations of the poor at such locations are either due to the fact that there is no other land available at reasonable cost or it is close to the employment opportunities. The inhabitations of the poor people on marginal land are prone to all types of disasters. The type of construction of these houses further deteriorates the condition. These dwellings made up of low cost material without giving much consideration to technical aspect are easy targets of various hazards.

## 1.8. Climate Pro fi le 5

1.8.1 India is home to an extraordinary variety of climatic regions, ranging from tropical in the south to temperate and alpine in the Himalayan north. The nation's climate is strongly in fl uenced by  the  Himalayas  and  the  Thar  deserts.  For  the  purpose  of  identi fi cation  of  drought  prone areas by Central Water Commission (CWC) the criteria adopted was that 'drought is a situation occurring in an area when the annual rainfall is less than 75 percent of normal in 20 percent of the years examined. Any block or equivalent unit where 30 percent or more of the cultivated area is irrigated is considered to have reached a stage, which enables it to sustain a reasonable protection against drought' .  A study rainfall data from 1875 to 1998 indicated the percentage area of the country a ff ected by moderate and severe drought. It may be noted that during the complete 124 year period there were three occasions i.e. 1877, 1899 and 1918 when percentage of the country a ff ected by drought was more than 60 percent).

1.8.2 In the span of 124 years, the probability of occurrence of drought was found maximum in Rajasthan (25 %), Saurastra &amp; Kutch (23%), followed by Jammu &amp; Kashmir (21%) and Gujarat (21%) region. The drought of 1987 in various parts of the country was of 'unprecedented intensity' resulting in serious crop damages and an alarming scarcity of drinking water.

1.8.3 Rainfall  in  India: The  country  is  in fl uenced  by  two  seasons  of  rains,  accompanied by  seasonal  reversal  of  winds  from  January  to  July.  Consequent  to  the  intense  heat  of  the summer months, the northern Indian landmass becomes hot and draws moist winds over the oceans causing a reversal of the winds over the region called the summer or the south-west (SW) monsoon. This is most important feature controlling the Indian climate because about 75 percent of the annual rainfall is received during a short span of four months ie June to September. There is a large variation in the amounts of rainfall received at di ff erent locations. The average annual rainfall is less than 13 cm over the western Rajasthan, while Mausiram in the Meghalaya has as much as 1141 cm. During the period from 1871 to 2009, there were 27 major drought years in India. One of the major reasons for these droughts has been a strong link with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) patterns and its linkages with Indian food grain production.

1.8.4 South West Monsoon: The rainfall over India has large spatial as well as temporal variability. A  homogeneous data series has been constructed for  the  period  1901-2003.  Mean  monthly rainfall during July (286.5 mm) is the highest and contributes about 24.2 percent of the annual rainfall  (1182.8  mm).  The  mean  rainfall  during  August  is  slightly  lower  and  contributes  21.2 percent of the annual rainfall. June and September rainfalls are almost similar and contribute 13.8 percent and 14.2 percent of the annual rainfall, respectively. The mean south-west monsoon (June, July, August and September) rainfall (877.2 mm) contributes 74.2 percent of the annual rainfall (1182.8 mm).

1.8.5 The onset of the SW monsoon normally starts over the Kerala coast, the southern tip of the country by 1st  June, advances along the Konkan coast in early June and covers the whole country by middle of July. Onset occurs about a week earlier over islands in the Bay of Bengal. The monsoon is in fl uenced by global and local phenomenon like EI Nino, northern hemisphere temperature, sea surface temperatures, snow cover etc. The monsoon rainfall oscillates between active spells associated with widespread rains over most parts of the country. Heavy rainfall in the mountainous catchment under 'break' conditions result in fl ooding of the plains.

1.8.6  Cyclonic  systems  of  low  pressure  called 'monsoon  depressions'  are  formed  in  the  Bay of Bengal during this season. These systems generally form in the northern part of the Bay with average frequency of about two to three per month and move in a northward or northwestward direction, bringing well distributed rainfall over the central and northern parts of the country. The SW monsoon generally starts withdrawing from Rajasthan by 1 st  September and from north-western part of India by 15 th September. It withdraws from almost all parts of the country by 15 th October. It is replaced by a northerly continental air fl ow called North-East Monsoon. The retreating monsoon winds cause occasional showers along the east coast of Tamil Nadu.

1.8.7 North East Monsoon: Post- monsoon or Northeast monsoon or Retreating SW Monsoon Season (October, November and December): North- East monsoon or post monsoon season is a transition season associated with the establishment of the north-easterly wind regime over the Indian sub continent. Meteorological subdivisions of coastal Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and South Interior Karnataka receive good amounts of rainfall accounting for about 35 percent of their annual total rainfall in these months. Many parts of this region are a ff ected due to the storms forming in the Bay of Bengal. Large scale losses to life and property occur due to heavy rainfall, strong winds and storm surges in the coastal region.

## 1.9 Cause and E ff ect of Disasters 6

1.9.1  India  is  vulnerable  to  extreme  weather  events  (Box  1.2).  Over  the  decade  of  the  1990s, both the number and severity of such events have increased. Weather events can be classi fi ed as  extreme  on  the  basis  of  various  factors  such  as  the  impact,  the  socio-economic  losses, environmental degradation and long term damages etc.

1.9.2 With more than 70 percent of India's population relying on agriculture directly or indirectly, the impact of extreme weather on human life and other living beings. is critical. In the state of Orissa, 49 years have experienced fl oods, 30 have had droughts, and 11 faced cyclones. These analyses have yielded a 30-year cyclicity of the Indian monsoons. Droughts were more common in  the  1960s. Of the 14 major drought years in the 85-year record, eight occurred in the fi rst 30 year period (1891-1920) whereas there was only one in the second 30 year period (19211950). In the 25-year period from 1951 -1981, fi ve major drought years were recorded. In 1972 and 1979 de fi cient rainfall (about 25% below normal) was recorded in one half to two thirds of India's plains. In 1994, monsoon rainfall was de fi cient (between 20% and 43%) in 10 of the 31 meteorological subdivisions of India.

1.9.3 According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), data of major natural disasters/ extremes that occurred around the world during the period 1963-2002, indicates that fl oods and droughts cause the maximum damage as shown in Table 1.6.

1.9.4 Floods and droughts occurring in India are closely associated with the nature and extent of the summer monsoon. The inter-annual fl uctuations in the summer monsoon rainfall over India are su ffi ciently large to cause devastating fl oods or serious droughts. Floods and droughts a ff ect vast areas of the country, transcending state boundaries. One-sixth area of the country is drought-prone. Out of 40 million hectares of the fl ood prone area in the country, on an average, fl oods a ff ect an area of around 7.5 million hectares per year.

## 1.10 Droughts 7

The primary cause of any drought is de fi ciency of rainfall and in particular, the timing, distribution and intensity of this de fi ciency in relation to existing reserves. A prolonged period of relatively dry  weather  leading  to  drought  is  a  widely  recognized  climate  anomaly.  Drought  can  be devastating as water supplies dry up, crops fail to grow, animals die, and malnutrition and ill health become widespread The environmental e ff ects of drought, including stalinization of soil and groundwater decline, increased pollution of freshwater ecosystems and regional extinction of animal species. The details of the drought years may be seen from the Table 1.7.

In India around 68 percent of the country is prone to drought in varying degrees. Of the entire area 35 percent receives rain falls between 750 mm and 1125 mm which is considers drought prone while 33 percent which receives rainfalls between less than 750 mm is considered to be chronically drought prone.

## 1.11. Floods 8

1.11.1  Flood  destructions  have  always  brought  miseries  to  numerous  people,  especially  in rural  areas.  Flood  results  in  the  outbreak  of  serious  epidemics,  specially  malaria  and  cholera. Simultaneously,  scarcity  of  water  also  arises.  It  has  a  drastic  e ff ect  on  agricultural  produce. Sometimes, water remains standing over large areas for long span of time hampering the Rabi crops. The fl ood hazard map of India may be seen in the Figure 1.11.

1.11.2 India is one of the most fl ood prone countries in the world. The principal reasons for fl ood lie in the very nature of natural ecological systems in this country, namely, the monsoon, the highly silted river systems and the steep and highly erodible mountains, particularly those of the Himalayan ranges. The average rainfall in India is 1150 mm with signi fi cant variation across the country. The annual rainfall along the western coast and Western Ghats, Khasi hills and over most of the Brahmaputra valley amounts to more than 2500 mm. Most of the fl oods occur during the monsoon period and are usually associated with tropical storms or depressions, active monsoon conditions and break monsoon situations.

1.11.3 Twenty-three of the 35 states and union territories in the country are subject to fl oods and 40 million hectares of land, roughly one-eighth of the country's geographical area, is prone to fl oods. The National Flood Control Program was launched in the country in 1954. Since then sizeable progress has been made in the fl ood protection measures. By 1976, nearly one third of the fl ood prone area had been a ff orded reasonable protection; considerable experience has been gained in planning, implementation and performance of fl ood warning, protection and control measures (CWC, 2007). Table 1.8 presents the fl ood a ff ected area and damages for the period 1953 to 2004 in India as per Water Data Complete Book 2005 and Central Water Commission, 2007).

1.11.4 Floods occur in almost all rivers basins in India. The main causes of fl oods are heavy rainfall, inadequate capacity of rivers to carry the high fl ood discharge, inadequate drainage to carry away the rainwater quickly to streams/ rivers. Ice jams or landslides blocking streams; typhoons and cyclones also cause fl oods.  Flash fl oods occur due to high rate of water fl ow as also due to poor permeability of the soil. Areas with hardpan just below the surface of the soil are more prone to, fl oods as water fails to seep down to the deeper layers.

1.11.5 Vulnerability to fl oods and other natural disasters is caused by the high population density, widespread poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, enormous pressure on rural land, and an economy traditionally dominated by agriculture. Children and women are particularly vulnerable. Eightyfi ve percent of the deaths during disasters are of women and children (Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, CRED 2000). Presently there is an inadequate level of protection in the country against fl oods. Though non-structural measures improve the preparedness to fl oods and reduce losses, the necessity of structural measures would always remain to reduce the extent of physical damage caused by fl oods.  In future, programme, fl ood control and management planning along with climate change need to be integrated into development planning for the country.

## 1.12 Tropical Cyclones 9

1.12.1 The major natural disaster that a ff ects the coastal regions of India is cyclone and as India has a coastline of about 7516 kms, it is exposed to nearly 10 percent of the world's tropical cyclones. About 71 percent of this area is in ten states (Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal). The islands of Andaman, Nicobar and Lakshadweep are also prone to cyclones. On an average, about fi ve or six tropical cyclones form in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian sea and hit the coast every year. Out of these, two or three are severe.

1.12.2  When  a  cyclone  approaches  to  coast,  a  risk  of  serious  loss  or  damage  arises  from severe winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges and river fl oods. The e ff ect of a storm surge is most pronounced in wide and shallow bays exposed to cyclones such as in the northern part of Bay of Bengal. On an average, fi ve or six tropical cyclones occur every year, of which two or three could be severe. Most cyclones occur in the Bay of Bengal followed by those in the Arabian Sea and the ratio is approximately 4:1. The incidence of cyclonic storms, with wind speeds between 65 Km/h and 117 Km/h and severe cyclonic storm with wind speeds between 119 Km/h and 164

Km/h, reaching Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh is high during the north east monsoon season ie. October - December, where as the highest annual number of storms, severe storms occur in the Orissa - West Bengal coast.

1.12.3 The yearly distribution of tropical cyclones in the north Indian Ocean indicates large yearto-year variations in the frequency of cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclones, but no distinct periodicity.  However,  the  trend  indicates  a  slight  decrease  with  time. The  annual  average  of cyclonic disturbances in the North Indian Ocean is about 15.7 with a standard deviation of 3.1. The annual number of cyclonic disturbances range from seven in 1984 to twenty three in 1927. The annual average of tropical cyclones has varied from one in 1949 to ten in 1893, 1926, 1930 and 1976. The Cyclone hazard map of India may be seen in the Figure 1.12. gives the vulnerability map of hazard due to cyclone.

1.12.4 A severe super cyclonic storm with winds of upto 250 km/hour crossed the coast in Orissa on October 29, 1999. This may have been the worst cyclone of the country in the Orissa region and was responsible for as many as 10,000 deaths, rendering millions homeless and extensive damage  to  property  and  environment.  Some  of  the  disastrous  tropical  storms  of  India  and Bangladesh are given in Table 1.9.

1.13.1 Extreme positive departures from the normal maximum temperature result in a heat wave during the summer season. The rising maximum temperature during the pre-monsoon months often continues till June, in rare cases till July, over the northwestern parts of the country. Table 1.10 gives the number of heat waves observed in India during 1911-1999.

mortality  and  discomfort.  Increased  minimum  temperatures  in  summer  do  not  allow  the necessary nocturnal cooling to neutralize the high maximum temperature during a heat wave epoch. Table 1.11 gives the details of the death due to the heat waves in India.

## 1.14 Cold Wave and Fog 11

1.14.1  Occurrences  of  extreme  low  temperature  in  association  with  incursion  of  dry  cold winds from north into the sub continent are known as cold waves. The northern parts of India, specially the hilly regions and the adjoining plains, are in fl uenced by transient disturbances in the mid latitude westerlies which often have weak frontal characteristics. These are known as western disturbances. The cold waves mainly a ff ect the areas to the north of 20°N but in association  with  large  amplitude  troughs,  cold  wave  conditions  are  sometimes  reported from states like Maharashtra and Karnataka as well. Table 1.12 gives the frequencies of the occurrence of cold waves in di ff erent parts of the country for di ff erent periods.  In recent years due to deterioration of the air quality in urban locations of India the deaths and discomfort from cold waves have been substantial.  UP and Bihar rank the highest in terms of casualties from cold wave and this could be due to poor level of development and lack of shelters to the outdoor workers and farmers.

## 1.15 Thunderstorm, Hailstorm and Dust Storm 12

1.15.1  As  winter  season  transforms  into  spring,  the  temperature  rises  initially  in the  southern  parts  of  India,  giving  rise  to  thunderstorms  and  squally  weather  which  are hazardous in nature. While the southernmost part of the country is free from dust storms and hailstorms, such hazardous weather a ff ects the central, northeastern, north and northwestern parts of the country.  The  hailstorm  frequencies are highest in the Assam valley, followed by hills  of  Uttarakhand,  Jharkhand  and  Vidarbha  Maharashtra  (Philip  &amp;  Daniel  1976).  However, thunderstorms  also  occur  in  Kolkatta,  Delhi,  Jaipur  and  Ahmedabad.  Tornadoes  are  rare  in India but some of them are quite devastating. Some of other tornadoes which caused extensive damage and destruction in the country is given in the Table 1.13.

## 1.16 Earthquakes 13

1.16.1 Globally, earthquakes result in a loss of about 50,000 lives every year. Earthquakes over 5.5 magnitude on the Richter scale are progressively damaging to property and human life. However, there are many other factors that in fl uences the damage pattern. Massive earthquakes generally occur near the junction of two tectonic plates, e.g., along the Himalayan range, where the Indian plate goes below Eurasian plate. The Indian sub- continent situated on the boundaries of two continental plates is very prone to earthquakes. Some of the most intense earthquakes of the world have occurred in India. Fortunately, none of these have occurred in any of the major cities. According to latest seismic zoning map brought out by the Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS), over 65 percent of the country is prone to earthquake of intensity Modi fi ed Mercalli Intensity Scale (MSK) VII or more.

1.16.2 India has been divided into four seismic zones according to the maximum intensity of earthquake expected (Figure 1.13). Of these, zone V is the most active which comprises of whole of Northeast India, the northern portion of Bihar, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, J&amp;K, Gujarat and Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands. India has highly populous cities and the constructions in these cities  are  not  earthquake  resistant.  Regulatory  mechanisms  are  weak,  thus  any  earthquake striking in one of these cities would turn into a major disaster. Six major earthquakes have struck di ff erent parts of India over a span of the last 15 years.

1.16.3 The entire Himalayan Region is considered to be vulnerable to high intensity earthquakes of a magnitude exceeding 8.0 on the Richter Scale, and in a relatively short span of about 50 years, four such major earthquakes have occurred in the region: Shillong, 1897 (M8.7); Kangra, 1905

(M.8.0); Bihar-Nepal, 1934 (M 8.3); and Assam-Tibet, 1950 (M 8.6). Scienti fi c publications have warned that very severe earthquakes are likely to occur anytime in the Himalayan Region, which could adversely a ff ect the lives of several million people in India. Some signi fi cant earthquakes in India are listed in the Table 1.14.

## 1.17 Landslides 14

1.17.1 Landslides mainly a ff ect the Himalayan region and the western ghats of India. Landslides are also common in the Nilgiri range. It is estimated that 30 percent of the world's landslides occur in  the  Himalayas. The Himalayan mountains, which constitute the youngest and most dominating mountain system in the world, are not a single long landmass but comprises a series of seven curvilinear parallel folds running along a grand arc for a total of 3400 kilometers. Due to its unique nature, the Himalayas have a history of landslides that has no comparison with any other mountain range in the world. Landslides are also common in western ghat. In the Nilgiris, in 1978 alone, unprecedented rains in the region triggered about one hundred landslides which caused severe damage to communication lines, tea gardens and other cultivated crops. A valley in Nilgiris is called  'Avalanches Valley' . Scienti fi c observation in north Sikkim and Garhwal regions in the Himalayas clearly reveal that there is an average of two landslides per sq. km. The mean rate of land loss is to the tune of 120 meter per km per year and annual soil loss is about 2500 tones per sq km. Fig 1.14 shows the landslide hazard zones in India

1.17.2  Landslides  constitute  a  major  natural  hazard  in  our  country,  which  accounts  for considerable loss of life and damage to communication routes, human settlements, agricultural fi elds and forest lands. Based on the general  experience with landslides, a rough estimate of monetary loss is of the order of ' 100 crore to ' 150 crore per annum at the current prices for the country as a whole.

## 1.18 Industrial and Chemical Disasters 15

1.18.1  Industrial  disasters  include  events  that  occur  due  to  mishaps  or  failures  in  industry or  related  activities  and  also  the  disasters  that  a ff ect  the  industrial  functions,  property  and productivity. 'Chemical Disasters' and 'Industrial Disasters' are terms often used interchangeably but are actually a sub-category of the other. A chemical disaster may occur due to both, natural or human-made sources, however, in view of growing chemical usage and industrial development worldwide,  the  pre-disaster  prevention  and  mitigation  of  chemical  (industrial)  disasters  is  a

serious concern.  It is estimated that there are currently over 1949 Major Accident Hazards units in India besides other small and medium-sized industries, in huge numbers, all across the nation. New industries are also coming up at a rapid rate.  A year wise list of chemical disasters for past decade may be seen in Table 1.15.

- 1.18.2 Industrial disaster: Industrial disasters are disasters caused by chemical, mechanical, civil, electrical or other process failures due to accident, negligence or incompetence, in an industrial plant  which  may  spill  over  to  the  areas  outside  the  plant  or  with  in  causing  damage  to  life, property and environment.

1.18.3 Chemical  disaster: Chemical  disasters  are  occurrence  of  emission, fi re  or  explosion involving  one  or  more  hazardous  chemicals  in  the  course  of  industrial  activity  (handling), storage or transportation or due to natural events leading to serious e ff ects inside or outside the installation likely to cause loss of life and property including adverse e ff ects on the environment. 'Chemical  accident  or  emergency  can  result  in  extensive  damage  to  the  environment  with considerable human and economic costs. Chemical and industrial emergencies may arise in a number of ways, such as -

- · Explosion in a plant
- · Accidents in storage facilities of chemicals
- · Accidents during the transportation of chemicals, misuse of chemicals
- · Improper waste management
- · Accidents in  treatment plants
- · Technological system failures
- · Failures of plant safety design
- · Arson and sabotage
- · Human error

## 1.19  Tsunami

1.19.1  Tsunamis  and  earthquakes  happen  after  centuries  of  energy  build  up  within  the earth. A tsunami (in Japanese 'tsu' means harbor and 'nami' means wave) is a series of water waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of a body of water, usually an ocean. In the Tamil language it is known as 'Aazhi Peralai' . Seismicity generated tsunamis are result of  abrupt  deformation  of  sea fl oor  resulting  vertical  displacement  of  the  overlying  water. Earthquakes occurring beneath the sea level, the water above the reformed area is displaced from its equilibrium position. The release of energy produces tsunami waves which have small amplitude but a very long wavelength (often hundreds of kilometer long). It may be caused by non-seismic event also such as a landslide or  impact  of a meteor.

1.19.2 Characteristics: Tsunami  in  the  deep  ocean  may  have  very  long  waves  length  of hundred of kilometer and travels at about 800 km per hour, but an amplitude of only about 1 km. It remains undetected by ships in the deep sea. However when it approaches the coast

its wavelength  diminishes  but  amplitude grows  enormously,  and  it  takes  very  little time to reach its full height. Computer model  can  provide  tsunami  arrival,  usually within minutes of the arrival time. Tsunamis have great erosion potential, stripping beaches of sand, coastal vegetation and dissipating its energy through the destruction of houses and coastal structure.

1.19.3 Tsunami Vulnerability 16 : Potential Tsunamigenic zones may  be  seen from Figure  1.15.  For  Tsunami  to  hit  the  Indian coast  according  to  INCOIS,  it  is  necessary that  the  earthquake  of  magnitude  more than  7.0  on  Richter  scale  should  normally occur. The possible zones for such an event to occur are Andaman - Sumatra or Makran (Pakistan).  Not  all  the  major  eqrthquakes are  Tsunamigenic.  Few  historical  events  to Tsunami in India may be seen in Box No. 1.3.

## Box 1. 4: Tsunami in Indian Ocean

The Tsunami of 26 th December 2004 caused extensive damage to life and property in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, UTs of Puducherry and Andman &amp; Nicobar Islands (A &amp; NI). The Tsunami disaster had badly a ff ected the fi shermen community who not only lost their near and dear ones but also lost their means of livelihood. A population of 26.63 lakhs in 1396 villages in fi ve states and UTs was a ff ected by this disaster. Almost 9395 people lost their lives and 3964 people were reported missing and feared dead. Most of the missing persons were from Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands.

1.19.4 Tsunami Risk Assessment 17 : A preliminary risk assessment has been done for the Indian Coast w.r.t. tsunamis taking into account the seismo-tectonic setting, historical seismicity and past tsunami events. The east and west coasts of India and the island regions are likely to be a ff ected  by  Tsunamis  generated  mainly  by  subduction  zone  related  earthquakes  from  the two potential source regions, viz., the Andaman-Nicobar-Sumatra Island Arc and the Makran subduction zone north of Arabian Sea.

Depending upon the location of the Earthquake, the response time for evacuation of coastal population could range between 10 minutes to a few hours (Figure 1.16). Tsunami modeling studies indicate that the least response time available is for the Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands which are  situated  right  on  the  subduction  zones  capable  of  triggering  tsunamigenic  earthquakes. Considering  that  a  credible  worst  case  earthquake  of  7.5  or  higher  occurs  near  Nicobar,  the

travel time to the nearest coast in Nicobar would be approximately 20 - 30 minutes and for the Indian mainland about 2 - 3 hours. For earthquakes occurring near Indonesia, the travel time to Andaman &amp; Nicobar would be in the range of 1 - 2 hours and to the Indian mainland about 3 - 5 hours. For earthquakes occurring o ff Makran, the travel time to the nearest Indian coast (Gujarat) would be about 2 - 3 hours. A table showing typical travel times of tsunami waves to a few Indian Coastal locations for 4 historic events is illustrated in Table 1.16.

## Box 1.5: Cascading e ff ect of Disaster - Earthquake, Tsunami, fi re and nuclear disaster:  Japan Experience 16

Event of one kind of Disaster sometimes lead  to  a  cascading  e ff ect  and  untold other  disasters.  The  preparedness  to respond  to  such  unforeseen  chain  of events is di ffi cult to visualize and plan and is going to be one of the challenges to  managers  engaged  in  DRR.  Recent experiences  of  earthquake  in  Japan leading to Tsunami, fi re and then nuclear emergency are an eye opener to  those  underestimating  the      might and  fury of nature.

## i. Earthquake

On 11 th March  2011,  at  14:46  the northeastern  part  of  Japan  was triggered  by  a  major  earthquake of magnitude 9 with an epicenter at  130  km      o ff the  paci fi c  coast of  Tohoku  region  and  depth  of

<!-- image -->

24 km. As per the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the seismic intensity of 7[in the Japanese scale of 1 to 7] was recorded in Kurihara city of Miyagi prefecture. Moreover, the intensity of 6+ was recorded in 28 cities and towns in Miyagi, Fukushima, Ibaraki, and Tochigi prefacture. It also included Wakuya town, Tome city and Osaki city. Intensity of 6 or weaker was observed in di ff erent parts of the country.

## ii. Tsunami

It was followed by a major Tsunami, with maximum height of 11.87 meter recorded near the coast of Akamae at 15:31 JST, Major tsunami of more than 3 m or more arrived in northern part of Japan: eastern, central, western part of paci fi c coast of Hokkaido, Paci fi c coast of Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Chiba prefecture, Kujukuri, &amp; Sotoboare and Izu islands. The earthquake in Japan also triggered warning in other countries such as Taiwan, Indonesia, Russia, Philippines, the paci fi c Islands, and as far away as Hawaii, Mexico and Colombia. The earthquake happened in 14:46, and the tsunami warning was issued at 14:49, and it was on the JMA website on 14:49.

The hypo-central region of this earthquake extends from o ff shore Iwate prefecture to o ff shore Ibaraki  prefecture  so  that  the  most  e ff ected  area  were  Iwate  prefecture,  Myagi  prefecture, Fukushima prefecture and Ibaraki prefecture The Japanese Meteorological Agency said that the earthquake may have ruptured the fault zone from Iwate to Ibaraki with a length of 500 km and a width of 200 km.

Following  the  9.0  magnitude  earthquake,  massive  waves  of  debrisfi lled  water  swept  away buildings,  cars,  and  ships.  Fires  occurred  in  several  cities  and  nuclear  power  plants,  re fi neries, airports, and parts of the transport networks were shut down.

As of 23 rd March, the resulted death was nearly 9,079, and 12,782 missing. The disaster also damaged 126,000 buildings, besides damaging other infrastructure, such as bridges, transportation system,

electricity,  gas  supplies,  and  communication  services.  Citigroup  expects  5-10  trillion  yen  in damage to housing and infrastructure, while Barclays Capital estimates economic losses of 15 trillion yen ($183.7 billion) or 3 percent of Japan's GDP .

## iii. Fire Events

On 11th March, several fi res' resulted due to powerful earthquake triggered near the east coast of Honshu, the largest and main island of Japan. Fire broke out at Cosmo Oil Company re fi nery in Ichihara city. The fi re continued till 14th March. The number of events increased after the fi rst day of earthquake, when only 44 cases were recorded. It increased to 325 cases on 19th March.

## iv. Nuclear Emergency

Same day at  20:30  CET  (04:30  JST),  a  nuclear  emergency  situation  at  the  Fukushima  Daiichi (number one) nuclear power plant was declared. Because of the intense earthquake all the three operating (out of six) reactors automatically began the process to be shut down. The back-up diesel generators for supplying the water to cool down the fuel rods inside the reactors due to the tsunami were damaged. The water available began to evaporate and at 15:30 JST on March 12 a fi rst hydrogen explosion took place at the number one reactor and led the Japanese government to evacuate people within a 20 km radius around the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. On March 14  at  11:01  JST,  another  explosion  took  place  in  reactor  number  3  at  the  Fukushima  Daiichi nuclear power plant. At 06:14 JST on March 15, another explosion took place in the number 2 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. And a fi re broke out in the number 4 reactor where spent fuel rods were stored to undergo their cooling process, soon after the fi re was extinguished. These incidents led to further increase of emission of radiation with levels up to 400 millisievert per hour near the site. (A person is normally not to be exposed to more than

2.4 millisivert per year!) Subsequently, the Japanese Government established a 30km radius 'No Fly Zone' around the Fukhushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. On March 17, the helicopters' water spraying supported by further units of the Self Defense Force (SDF) shot water from the ground, using heavy water cannon trucks, into the most troubled number 3 reactor which  continued the following days. Meanwhile new power cables were installed to provide the reactors number 1 and 2 with energy to start-up again the cooling mechanisms. Increased radiation levels were reported in  spinach,  milk  and  tap  water  outside  the  demarcated  30km  evacuation  zone.  Farmers  were advised to voluntarily avoid distributing contaminated food into the markets.

## V. Lessons

This recent event is a pointer to the need to have a multi-hazard approach and plan to handle unexpected disasters. Japan as a country is one of the best prepared countries, yet had to face the cascading impact of disasters starting from the large undersea earthquake, resultant Tsunami, fi re and nuclear and energy related emergencies in addition to the disaster linked loss of life, livelihood assets etc.

## 1.20  Stampede 18

The term stampede is applied to a sudden rush of a crowd of people, usually resulting in many injuries and death from su ff ocation and trampling. In stampede, the term mob or crowd is used to refer to a congregated, active, polarized aggregate of people, which is basically heterogeneous and complex.  Its most salient features include homogeneity of thought and action among its participants and their impulsive and irrational actions.

1.20.1 Causes: Incidents of stampedes can occur in numerous socio-cultural situations. These stampede  incidents  can  be  categorized  into  the  following  types,  where  the  causes  and  the impact are described in the incident.  Though the list is not exhaustive, it provides a fair idea about various types of situations where stampedes can occur.

- · Entertainment events
- · Escalator and moving  walkways
- · Food distribution
- · Processions
- · Natural disasters
- · Power failure
- · Religious events
- · Fire incidents during  religious/other events
- · Riots
- · Sports events
- · Weather related

## 1.21. Nuclear Emergencies 19

1.21.1  Nuclear  emergency  /Disaster  is  caused  due  to  an  extraordinary  release  of  radioactive material  or  radiation  either  in  the  operation  of  nuclear  reactors  or  other  nuclear  events  like explosion  of  a  Radiological  Dispersal  Device  (RDD)  or  Improvised  Nuclear  Device  (IND)  or explosion of a nuclear weapon. It is accompanied with sudden release of harmful radiations or radioactive materials or both together in to the environment.

- (i) Nuclear emergency may be encountered in the following situations: Intentional use of nuclear weapons in the event of war:  Nuclear attacks may make use of nuclear weapons, which  are  extremely  destructive  and  powerful  enough  to  destroy  an  entire  city.  With the advancement of scienti fi c research in the world, several countries have acquired the technology to produce nuclear weapons, which are more destructive and harmful than the atom bomb used more than half a century ago against Japan during the Second World War.
- (ii) Accidents in nuclear power project:  The nuclear Power Plants take care of safety by Engineered safety features by design and  redundancy in  safety systems to prevent any mal-operations and to bring the system to a safe shut down in case of any abnormalities. However, in case of a major malfunction, there is a remote possibility of release of radioactivity/ radiation  to the environment.  The area a ff ected would depend on the amount of the release, and wind direction, speed and weather conditions.
- (iii) Accidents in handling radiation sources :Other accidental exposure of radiation could be due to accident with the radioactive material during transportation, wrong/faulty practices, failure of machinery of a radiation facility etc. A brief summary of the accidents between 1987 to 2010 are given in Table 1.18.

| 4 May 1987     | Kalpakkam, India                   | In  an  incident  during    refueling  of  FBTR,  structural  deformation happened in some of the fuel assemblies.  There  was  no  release  of  radioactivity.  The  reactor  remained shut down for about two years for restoration  which  involved  development  of  special  tools,  inspection and removal of a ff ected fuel assemblies. |
| 13 May 1992    | Tarapur, Maharashtra, India        | There  was  a  minor  tube  leak  in  one  heat  exchanger  which  was  subsequently  replaced.

1.21.3 Radiation releases due to any reason can be devastating - Chernobyl is a good example. With modern reactor design, a catastrophic release of radiation is highly unlikely, but nevertheless, possible. This  can  happen  due  to  factors  beyond  the  control  of  the  operating  agencies  e.g., human error, system failure, sabotage, earthquake, cyclone, fl ood and tsunami etc.

## 1.22 Road Accidents 18

1.22.1 The rapid expansion of road transport has brought with it the challenge of addressing adverse factors such as the increase in road accidents. Road accidents are a human tragedy. It involves high human su ff ering and monetary costs in terms of premature deaths, injuries, loss of productivity etc. Most deaths and injuries due to road accidents are invisible to society. They are a hidden epidemic. In India, motor vehicles including two wheelers are growing at a faster rate then the economic and population growth.

1.22.2 Global Status Report on Road Safety (WHO, 2009) has estimated that 1.2 million people die  on  the  world's  road  every  year,  and  as  many  as  50  million  others  are  injured.  Over  90%  of deaths occurred in low income and middle income countries, which have only 48% of the world's registered vehicles. The problem of road safety is acute in India. In the year 2008 alone, number of road accidents were 4.8 lakh resulting in close to 1.2 lakh deaths and 5.2 lakh injured, many of whom are disabled for rest of their lives. Sadly, many of these victims are economically active young people.

1.22.3 Trends in accidents, injuries, fatalities, motor vehicles &amp; road network: Between 1970 and 2008, the number of accidents quadrupled with more than 7 fold increase in injuries and more than 8 fold increase in fatalities in the backdrop of about 64 fold increase in the number of registered motor vehicles and threefold increase in road network.

1.22.4 Pro fi le of road accidents: The proportion of fatal accidents in the total road accidents has consistently increased since 2001 as re fl ected in Table 1.19 and 1.20. The severity of road accidents measured in terms of persons killed per 100 accidents is observed to have increased from less than 20 in 2001 to 24.7 in 2008.

Table 1.19:  Number of Accidents and Number of Persons Involved : 2001 to 2008

1.22.6 Classi fi cation of Accidents: National Highways accounted for 29% in total road accidents and 36% in total number of persons killed in 2008. Similarly, State Highways accounted for 26%of total accidents and a share of close to 28 % in the total number of persons killed in road accidents in 2008 (Table 1.21). Highways permit greater speed resulting in relatively greater number of road accidents and fatalities.

| Road Classi fi cation   | National Highways   | State Highways   | Other Roads    |
|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------|
| No. of Accidents        | 137995 (28.47)      | 123972 (25.58)   | 222737 (45.95) |
| No. of Persons Killed   | 42670 (35.60)       | 34081 (28.43)    | 43109 (35.97)  |
| No. of Persons  Injured | 149693 (28.61)      | 143708 (27.47)   | 229792 (43.92) |

Figure 1.18 shows that, there is increased percentage of accidents in other roads than the national state highways and Figure 1.19 shows that there is loss of life similar to other road and national highways but less life loss in state highways.

## Disaster Management in India

1.22.7 International  Comparisons  of  Road  Tra ffi c  Injury,  Accidents  and  Deaths: Cross country  comparisons  of  incidence  of  road  accident  related  deaths  and  injury  accidents per  lakh  persons  as  per  World  Road  Statistics  2009  (published  by  International  Road Federation, Geneva) shows lower incidence of both the parameters for India in comparison to many developed and developing countries. The number of road accident deaths per lakh of population at 10.5 in India was much lower compared with 12.72 in Korea and 13.68 in USA. Similarly, injury accidents per lakh of population for both in India and China were substantially lower at around 36.69 and 24.82 respectively when compared to U.K.  (298.54), USA (579.68), France (131.75), Germany (408.23).

## 1.23 Rail Accidents 21

1.23.1 Based on the de fi nition of the Disaster Management Act 2005, Ministry of Railways has adopted the following de fi nition on Railway Disaster: 'Railway Disaster is a serious train accident or an untoward event of grave nature, either on railway premises or arising out of railway activity, due to natural or human-made causes, that may lead to loss of many lives and /or grievous injuries to a large number of people, and/or severe disruption of tra ffi c etc, necessitating large scale help from other government/non-government and private organizations.'

1.23.2 Nodal Department for policy Formulation on DM on Indian Railways: The preparation of Disaster Management Plan on Indian railways and on the Zonal Railways in coordination with the  di ff erent  Departments  of  the  Railway,  other  Central/State  Govt.  agencies,  NGOs,  private agencies, etc. has to be done by the Safety Department in the railway Board, on the Zonal Railway and Divisions. Railway Board has approved the nomination of GMs, AGMs or CSOs (when GM/ AGM is not available) for declaring an untoward incident as a Railway Disaster.

1.23.4 Train accident analysis: The statistics of the death and injured in the consequential train accidents during the last ten years are given in Table 1.22:

## 1.24 Air Accidents 22

1.24.1 Air accidents are by and large of four  types; mid-air collisions, forced landings, crash due to technical snags and air-crash in mountainous terrain due to poor visibility. While air accidents can occur at any time and at any place, areas within about 30 - 40 kms. radius of airports are most vulnerable. Experience shows that a majority of air accidents occur either during take-o ff or landing near major airports where fl ight paths get congested. In addition, air accidents also take place at remote inaccessible places like forests, hilly and mountainous regions, high seas, etc.  Accidents to Indian Civil Registered Aircraft from 1990 to 2000 may be seen in Table 1.23.

1.24.2 Causes: Causes of air accidents are either human failure of pilots, air tra ffi c  controllers or technical failures of on board, landing instruments. In rare cases, it may also be the result of terrorist activities.

- · Side fall (slope failure) disaster in opencast mines,
- · Roof and side falls in underground mines,
- · Collapse of mine pillars,
- · Air Blast,
- · Failure of rope haulage,
- · Accident due to electricity,
- · Mine fires,
- · Accidents due to explosive,
- · Inundations,
- · Explosions in mines.
- · Rock burst and bumps,

## 1.26 Epidemics in India 24

1.26.1 Infectious diseases are a major public health problem in India. While many infectious diseases like tuberculosis and malaria are endemic, some of them occasionally attain epidemic proportion. An epidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in number of cases of a disease in a community clearly in excess of what is normally expected in that population. Epidemics are  public  health  emergencies  which  disrupt  routine  health  services  and  are  major  drain on  resources.  Epidemics  include  viral  infections  disease  (mengitis,  measles,  dengue,  polio, typhoid fever etc.) and Bacterial infectious diseases (cholera, diarrheoa etc.) The main causes for  epidemic  are  non  availability  of  clean  and  hygienic  drinking  water  contamination  of drinking water sources, lack of awareness about sanitation, unhygienic food, overcrowding, biological conditions in addition to ecological factors.   Besides direct costs in epidemic control measures and treatment of patients, the indirect costs due to negative impact on domestic and international tourism and trade can be signi fi cant. For example, plague which was not reported from any part of India for almost a quarter of century, caused a major outbreak in Beed district in Maharashtra and  Surat in Gujarat in 1994 and resulted in an estimated loss of almost US$ 1.7 billion.

1.26.2 Several factors related to microbes, environment and host susceptibility contribute to the  occurrence  of  epidemics.  Because  of  prevalence  of  these  factors,  developing  countries including India are frequently a ff ected by epidemics/ outbreaks which result in high morbidity and mortality and a ff ect  the  public  health  and  economy  adversely.  Outbreaks  reported  by States under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) during the period 2008-2010 are shown in Table 1.27.

1.26.3 As shown in the Table 1.27, most of the outbreaks/epidemics reported in India are due to water-borne diseases, vector-borne diseases and vaccine preventable diseases. While National Vector  Borne  Diseases  Control  Programme  (NVBDCP)  is  the  key  programme  for  prevention/ control of outbreak of epidemics of malaria, dengue, chikungunya etc, vaccines administered under  UIP/EPI  reduce  the  morbidity  and  mortality  due  to  diseases  like  measles,  diphtheria, pertussis,  poliomyelitis  etc.  Availability  of  safe  water  and  adoption  of  personal  and  domestic hygienic practices are important measures to prevent/control epidemics of water-borne diseases like cholera, viral hepatitis etc.

## 1.27 Deaths due to Unnatural Cause 25

1.27.1 A comparative list prepared by National Crime Record Bureau, MHA for year 2008 and 2009 in respect of death due to unnatural cause have been given in Table 1.28, which would show the enormity of problems leading to such deaths which attracts little attention due to their sporadic nature and such calamity  happening in a di ff used manner and not in one event generally.

1.27.2 Analysis of deaths due to Accidents: Accidents - human-made and natural - are among the  two  most  important  reasons  of  pre-mature  end  to  human  lives.  Injuries  resulting  from the  accidents  handicap  many  people. These  unfortunate  victims  are  important  members  of their families as well as of the society. This way, the loss due to accidents and suicides is felt by family members and society at large. The deep and wide impact of accidents and suicides make it incumbent upon society to make e ff orts at reducing the incidence of these phenomena. Appropriate intervention measures can be devised only after studying various facets of these phenomena. Detailed data is a sine qua non for any study. While individual disaster and event data  maintained  by  the  states  and  reported  to  the  GOI  may  not  accurately  tally  with  the

NCRB report as some are maintained calendar year wise and some fi nancial year wise yet the NCRB collected data is a useful data for analysis. This data on accidental deaths due to causes attributable to nature  - such as cyclone /  tornado, earthquake, fl ood, landslide and torrential rains, to name a few - as well as those not attributable to nature - for example, explosion, fi re, sudden deaths, stampede, tra ffi c accidents and others are revealing. These may be seen from the Figure 1.21. Accidental deaths due to natural causes were 6.2 % and those due to unnatural causes were 93.8% and tra ffi c accidents account for the maximum deaths. These trends are a cause of concern for every class of the society, especially to policy makers principally for two reasons. Firstly, the Government is committed for improving the living conditions of its citizens and Secondly, the loss of these lives results in irreparable damage to the society.

## 1.28 Conclusion

A series of catastrophes across the world in recent times have served as a reminder and backdrop of the chapters following the overview which is an attempt to capture valuable and available information across sectors and departments with focus on disaster management. It is hoped that the information will serve as a tool to improve the roles and capacities of all the stakeholders while facing the hazards, risks and the resultant disasters.

## 2.1  Evolution of Disaster Management in India

Disaster management in India has evolved from an activity-based reactive setup to a proactive institutionalized structure; from single faculty domain to a multi-stakeholder setup; and from a relief-based approach to a 'multi-dimensional pro-active holistic approach for reducing risk' . The beginnings of an institutional structure for disaster management can be traced to the British period following the series of disasters such as famines of 1900, 1905, 1907 &amp; 1943, and the Bihar-Nepal earthquake of 1937. Over the past century, the disaster management in India has undergone substantive changes in its composition, nature and policy.

## 2.2 Disaster Management during British Administration and Post Independence

During  the  British  administration,  relief  departments  were  set  up  for  emergencies  during disasters. Such an activity-based setup with a reactive approach was functional only in the postdisaster  scenarios. The  policy  was  relief-oriented  and  activities  included  designing  the  relief codes and initialising food for work programmes. Post-Independence, the task for managing disasters continued to rest with the Relief Commissioners in each state, who functioned under the Central Relief Commissioner, with their role limited to delegation of relief material and money in the a ff ected areas. Every fi ve-year plan addressed fl ood disasters under 'Irrigation, Command Area Development and Flood Control' . Until this stage, the disaster management structure was activity-based, functioning under the Relief Departments.

## 2.3 Emergence of Institutional Arrangement in India

A permanent and institutionalised setup began in the decade of 1990s with set up of a disaster management cell under the Ministry of Agriculture, following the declaration of the decade of 1990 as the 'International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction' (IDNDR) by the UN General Assembly. Following series of disasters such as Latur Earthquake (1993), Malpa Landslide (1994), Orissa Super Cyclone (1999) and Bhuj Earthquake (2001), a high powered Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. J.C.  Pant,  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  was  constituted  for  drawing up a systematic, comprehensive and holistic approach towards disasters. There was a shift in policy from an approach of relief through fi nancial aid to a holistic one for addressing disaster management. Consequently, the disaster management division was shifted under the Ministry of  Home  A ff airs  in  2002  vide  Cabinet  Secretariat's  Noti fi cation  No.  DOC.CD-108/2002  dated 27/02/2002 and a hierarchical structure for disaster management evolved in India.

## 2.4  Organisation and Structure of Disaster Management

The Disaster Management Division is headed by Joint Secretary (DM) in MHA, who is assisted by three Directors, Under Secretaries, Section O ffi cers, Technical O ffi cer, Senior Economic Investigator consultants and other supporting sta ff . The upper echelon of the structure consists of Secretary (Border Management), Home Secretary, Minister of State in charge and the Home Minister.

## 2.5 Disaster Management Framework

Shifting from relief and response mode, disaster management in India started to address the issues of early warning systems, forecasting and monitoring setup for various weather related hazards. A structure for fl ow of information, in the form of warnings, alerts and updates about the oncoming hazard, also emerged within this framework. A multi-stakeholder High powered group  was  setup  by  involving  representatives  from  di ff erent  ministries  and  departments. Some of these ministries were also designated as the nodal authorities for speci fi c disasters.

## Disaster Management in India

Following a High Powered Committee Report on Disaster Management for establishment of a  separate  institutional  structure  for  addressing  disasters  and  enactment  of  a  suitable  law for  institutionalizing  disaster  management in the country, a multi-level links between these ministries  and  the  disaster  management  framework  have  emerged.  Disaster  Management framework may be seen in Figure 2.8.

## 2.6 Present Structure for Disaster Management in India

2.6.1 The institutional structure for disaster management in India is in a state of transition. The new setup, following the implementation of the Act, is evolving; while the previous structure also continues (Figure 2.1). Thus, the two structures co-exist at present. The National Disaster Management Authority has been established at the centre, and the SDMA at state and district authorities at district level are gradually being formalized. In addition to this, the National Crisis Management  Committee,  part  of  the  earlier  setup,  also  functions  at  the  Centre.  The  nodal ministries, as identi fi ed for di ff erent disaster types of function under the overall guidance of the Ministry of Home A ff airs (nodal ministry for disaster management).  This makes the stakeholders interact at di ff erent levels within the disaster management framework.

2.6.2 Within this transitional and evolving setup, two distinct features of the institutional structure for disaster management may be noticed. Firstly, the structure is hierarchical and functions at four levels - centre, state, district and local. In both the setups - one that existed prior to the implementation of the Act, and other that is being formalized post-implementation of the Act, there have existed institutionalized structures at the centre, state, district and local levels. Each preceding level guides the activities and decision making at the next level in hierarchy. Secondly, it is a multi-stakeholder setup, i.e., the structure draws involvement of various relevant ministries, government departments and administrative bodies.

2.16.4 The Government of India has approved the raising of two additional battalions of National Disaster  Response  Force  by  upgradation  and  conversion  of  one  battalion  each  of  Border Security Force and Central Reserve Police Force to be located in the states of Bihar (Bihata, Patna) and Andhra Pradesh (Vijaywada) respectively. The administrative approval for raising the two battalions was issued on 13-10- 2010.

2.16.5  There  are  di ff erent  training  institutes  where  such  forces  are  given  the  basic  and specialised training. The details of such training programmes are given in Chapter 7 of  Capacity Development.

## 2.17 State Disaster Response Force (SDRF)

The  states/UTs    have  also  been  advised  to  set  up  their  own  Specialist  Response  Force  for responding to disasters  on the lines of National Disaster Response Force vide Ministry of Home A airs letter dated 26 th ff July 2007 and 8 th March, 2011. The Central Government is providing assistance for training of trainers. The state governments have been also advised to utilise 10 percent of their State Disaster Response Fund and Capacity Building Grant for the procurement of search and rescue equipment and for training purposes of the Response Force.

## 2.18 Civil Defence

2.18.1 Aims and Objectives of Civil Defence Act: The Civil Defence Policy of the GoI until 1962 was con fi ned to making the states and UTs conscious of the need of civil protection measures and to keep in readiness civil protection plans for major cities and towns under the Emergency Relief Organisation (ERO) scheme. The legislation on Civil Defence (CD) known as Civil Defence Act was enacted in 1968 which is in force throughout the country.

2.18.2  The  Act  de fi nes  CD  and  provides  for  the  powers  of  Central  Government  to  make rules  for  CD,  spelling  out  various  actions  to  be  taken  for  CD  measures.  It  further  stipulates for  constitution  of  CD  corps,  appointment  of  members  and  o ffi cers,  functions  of  members etc. The Act has since been amended in 2010 to cater to the needs of disaster management

so as to utilise the services of Civil Defence volunteers e ff ectively for enhancement of public participation in disaster management related activities in the country.

- 2.18.3  The  CD  Organisation  is  raised  only  in  such  areas  and  zones  which  are  considered vulnerable to enemy attacks. The revision and renewal of categorised CD towns is done at regular intervals, with the level of perceived threat or external aggression or hostile attacks by anti- national elements or terrorists to vital installations.
- 2.18.4 Compendium of instructions - CD deals very brie fl y with all di ff erent aspects of CD in India and includes references to important policy letters including legal aspects.  It was fi rst published in February 1969. Subsequently, its scope was enlarged by including the Master Plan of Civil Defence, Civil Defence Act 1968, training courses conducted at NCDC, Nagpur, training syllabus of states.
- 2.18.5 Role of Civil Defence: During times of war and emergencies, the CD  organisation has the vital role of guarding the hinterland, supporting the armed forces, mobilising the citizens and helping civil administration for saving life and property, minimising damage, maintaining continuity in production centers and raising public morale. The concept of CD over the years has shifted from management of damage against conventional weapons to also include threat perceptions  against  nuclear  weapons,  biological  and  chemical  warfare  and  environmental disasters.
- 2.18.6 Three tier structure as given below has been created to formulate CD policy and for coordinating and supervising measures to implement it.
- · Civil Defence Advisory Committee under the Chairmanship of Union Home Minister,
- · Civil Defence Committee under the Chairmanship of Home Secretary and
- · Civil Defence Joint Planning Staff Committee under the Chairmanship of Director General Civil Defence.

## 2.18.7 Eligibility to become volunteers:

- ( a)  A person who intends to apply for appointment to a Civil Defence Corps must ful fi ll the following conditions:-
- · to be a citizen of India or Bhutan or of Nepal;
- · to have completed the age of 18 years provided that this age limit may be relaxed at the discretion of the competent authority up to a maximum of three years for any branch or category of the Corps,
- · to have passed at least the primary standard, that is to say, the fourth class; and this condition may be relaxed by the Controller at his discretion.
- (b) A  person  shall  not  be  entitled  to  be  appointed  to  the  Corps  unless  he  is  found  to  be physically fi t and mentally alert.
- (c) Any service in the National Volunteer Force and in the armed forces of the Union shall be a special quali fi cation

## Disaster Management in India

- (d) Such  persons  shall  ordinarily  serve  in  a  voluntary  and  honorary  capacity  and  they are required to perform the duties assigned to them by order under the Civil Defence Regulations, 1968 or under any other law for the time being in force, for the protection of persons and property against hostile attack
- (e) A  candidate  who  has  been  accepted  for  appointment  to  the  Corps  shall  be  formally enrolled in such manner as the Controller may, by order, determine and at the time of enrollment shall make an oath or a ffi rmation before such o ffi cer as the Controller may, by order, appoint.
- 2.18.8 Directorate General of Civil Defence (DGCD): DGCD was established in 1962 with its headquarters at New Delhi in the Ministry of Home A ff airs to handle all policy and planning matters related to Civil Defence, Home Guards and Fire Services including the functioning of National Civil Defence College, and National Fire Service College, Nagpur. An IPS o ffi cer in the rank of Director General of Police heads the organisation. He has dual charge of D.G. National Disaster Response Force and Civil Defence (DG, NDRF &amp; CD).

2.18.9 Civil Defence Setup in the States: The state government for the purpose of coordinating the activities of the Controllers of Civil Defence within the state appoints a Director of Civil Defence and also may constitute, for any area within the state a body of a person to be called the Civil Defence Corps. Out of 225 towns from 35 states noti fi ed as CD towns, currently the CD organisations at only 130 towns have been activated. Each town has nucleus of four Permanent Sta ff along with 400 CD Volunteers for a two lakh population. It is expected that each state will have one CD Training Institute with permanent strength of 36 personnel, fi ve vehicles and other equipments. The District Magistrate is designated  as a Controller for CD Towns. The present  strength of CD volunteers is 5.72 lakhs, out of which 5.11 lakhs are already trained. The target strength of CD volunteers has been fi xed at 13 lakhs based on the population of CD towns as per 2001 census.

In  accordance  with  the  directions  issued  by  Hon'ble  Home  Minister,  one  member  high powered committee was constituted on 7th February, 2006 under the chairmanship of one of the member of NDMA to analyse the existing functions of Civil Defence Organisations and suggest changes required to enlarge its role to include Disaster Management.

2.18.10 Civil  Defence  at  district  level: The  state  government  may  appoint  a  person,  not being in its opinion, below the rank of a District Magistrate to be known as the 'Controller' . Under certain conditions, the state government may also appoint a Deputy Controller of Civil Defence in appropriate rank up to that of Deputy Collector, but not inferior to that of a SubDivisional Magistrate.

## 2.19 Fire Services

2.19.1  Fire  services  are  mandate  of  the  Municipal  Bodies  as  estimated  in  item  7  of  Schedule 12 under Article 243W of the constitution. The structure across is not uniform. Presently Fire prevention and Fire Fighting Services are organized by the concerned States and UTs. Ministry of Home A ff airs, Govt. of India, renders technical advice to the States and UTs and Central Ministries on Fire Protection, Fire Prevention and Fire Legislation.

2.19.2 The Government of India in 1956, formed a  'Standing Fire Advisory Committee' under the Ministry of Home A ff airs.  The mandate of the committee was to examine the technical problems

relating to Fire Services and to advise the Government of India for speedy development and upgradation of Fire Services all over the country. This committee had representation from each State Fire Services, as well as the representation from Ministry of Home, Defence, Transport, Communication and Bureau of Indian Standards. This Committee was renamed as 'Standing Fire Advisory Council' (SFAC) during the year 1980.

2.19.3 Fire Services in Gujarat, Chhatisgarh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and  Madhya  Pradesh  excluding  Indore  are  under  the  respective  concerned  Municipal Corporations. In other remaining States it is under the Home Department. While some States have enacted their own Fire Act, some others have not. As on today, there is no standardization with  regard  to  the  scaling  of  equipment,  the  type  of  equipment,  or  the  training  of  their manpower. In each state it has grown according to the initiatives taken by the States and the funds provided for the Fire Services.

2.19.4 Presently the only Basic Life Line of Fire &amp; Emergency Services which is fully committed to  the  common public, is the Municipal in some states and State Fire Services. The Airport Authority, Big Industrial Establishments, CISF and Armed Forces, however also have their own Fire Services and many a times in case of need rush in aid to the local Fire Services.  Apart from  the  lack  of  being  a  proper  government  department  with  a  complete  developmental plan, State Fire Services have their own organizational structure, administrative setup, funding mechanism, training facilities and equipments.

## 2.20 National Civil Defence College (NCDC), Nagpur

The fi rst Disaster Management Training Institution of the country was founded on 29 th April 1957 at Nagpur as the Central Emergency Relief Training Institute (CERTI) to support the Emergency Relief Organisation of the Government of India. This Institute organised advanced and specialist training for revenue o ffi cials  responsible for Disaster Relief Operations against any natural or manmade  disaster.  CERTI  was  renamed  as  National  Civil  Defence  College  on  1 st April  1968. NCDC is mandated for conducting training courses for various groups of stakeholders. Details of training on capacity development are given in Chapter on Capacity Development

## 2.21 National Fire Service College (NFSC), Nagpur

2.21.1 The National Fire Service College was established in 1956 as a sub- ordinate establishment of Ministry of Home A ff airs with the aim of providing training to the Fire O ffi cers of the country in advanced techniques of fi re fi ghting and rescue, and creating uniformity in the Fire Service organisations and their management across the country. NFSC began its activities with only one course; later, considering the needs of the country, industrialisation and growth of Indian industry, had added many more courses to its curriculum to give the fi re training a professional outlook.

2.21.2 The  college  has  so  far  trained  15197 fi re  o ffi cers  in  the  country.  Being  a  residential college, National Fire Service College (NFSC), has its own hostel facilities with well furnished accommodation for about 200 trainees at a time.

2.21.3  The  college  awards  certi fi cates,  diplomas,  and  advanced  diplomas  on  successful completion of courses. These are recognized by the state, central government, the public and

## Disaster Management in India

private sectors and the business community as well. In addition, the diploma and advanced diploma of NFSC are also recognised by the Union Public Service Commission for appointment in the middle management cadre.

## 2.22 Home Guard

2.22.1 Role: The role of Home Guards is to serve as an auxiliary to the police in the maintenance of law and order, internal security and help the community in any kind of emergency such as air-raid, fi re, cyclone, earthquake, epidemic etc. They are also expected to help the police in maintenance of communal harmony, assist the administration in protecting weaker sections, participate in socio-economic and welfare activities and perform Civil Defence duties.

2.22.2 Types: Home Guards are of two types - rural and urban besides in Border States, Border Wing Home Guards Battalions at national level. Border Wing, Home Guard serve as an auxiliary to the Border Security Force. The total strength of Home Guards is 5, 73,793 against which the raised strength is 5,00,410. The organisation is spread over all states and UTs except in Kerala.

Eighteen Border Wing Home Guards (BWHG) Battalions have been raised in the border states viz. Punjab (6 Bns.), Rajasthan (4 Bns.), Gujarat (4Bns.) and one of Bn each. for Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura  and  West  Bengal  to  serve  as  an  auxiliary  to  Border  Security  Force  for  preventing in fi ltration on the international border and coastal areas, guarding of vital Installations and lines of communication in vulnerable areas at the time of external aggression.

2.22.3 Statutory Mechanisms and Service Condition: Home Guards are raised under the Home Guards Act and Rules of the states and UTs. They are recruited from a cross section of  the  population such as doctors, engineers, lawyers, private sector organisations, college and university students, agricultural and industrial workers, etc. who give their spare time to the organisation for betterment of the community. Home Guards are provided free uniform, duty allowances and awards for gallantry, distinguished and meritorious services. Members of  Home  Guards  with  three  year  service  in  the  organisation  are  trained  to  assist  police  in maintenance of law and order, prevention of crime, anti-decoity measures, border patrolling, prohibition, fl ood relief, fi refi ghting, election duties and social welfare activities.

The  Ministry  of  Home  A ff airs  formulates  the  policy  regarding  role,  target,  raising,  training, equipping, establishment and other important matters of Home Guards Organisation.

## 2.23 Interface between the Ministries for disaster Management

2.23.1 The  interface  between  stakeholders  and  the  disaster  management  framework  is permanent, backed by legislative measures, decisions, such as those taken for establishment of the bodies and committees for managing disasters and the government orders to execute these  decisions.  These  decisions  or  measures  direct  the  composition  of  the  structure  by identifying the stakeholders to be involved in the disaster management framework. The role to be performed by each stakeholder is in the evolving stage and needs to be de fi ned within di ff erent SOPs. Thus, while the involvement of stakeholders in the interface is mandated and permanent, the nature of interface is guided by the expertise or relevance of the stakeholder to the disaster management framework.

2.23.2 The expertise based interfaces emerge when the stakeholders serve as 'service providers' to the disaster management framework. For instance, the institutions under Ministry of Earth

Sciences and Ministry of Water Resources, that is, Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Central Water Commission (CWC) respectively, provide information on the weather and climatic parameters and the potential hazards and threats to the nodal management authority. Further, these organizations are involved with disaster planning activities fl ood zonation and fl ood plain management in case of CWC, and hazard mapping and database generation in case of IMD. The organizations and institutions under the Department of Space provide research and technical support by monitoring the weather elements and facilitating satellite based communication, and also undertaking activities such as land use mapping and hazard zoning.

2.23.3 The framework which emerges from above discussion may be summarised in a fl ow chart form as given in Figure 2.8.

Figure 2.8: Interface among the stakeholders, leading to the development of society

2.23.3 The  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  (DRR)  should  be  seen  as  on  integral  part  of  environment (climate change also) and development. The impending risk analysis should be done in the light of disasters and possible threat of high intensity disasters due to climate change. Accordingly, mitigation and adaptation programmes should be developed. The mitigation plan should address the issues of structural and non-structural interventions along with the fi scal and monetary tools (for DRR &amp; adaptation) for pre and post disaster planning. If this is main streamed, sustainable development can be attained and miseries of the people could be minimised. The top down and bottom up institutional linkages for policy formulation and programme execution would be interdependent with each other.

## 3.1 Introduction

3.1.1 The  National  Authority,  under  the  Disaster  Management  Act,  has  been  mandated  with the responsibility for laying down the policies, plans and guidelines for disaster management to ensure timely and e ff ective response to disasters.  It is further required to approve the plans prepared by the ministries or departments of the Government of India in accordance with the national plans.  The guidelines laid down by the National Authority have to be followed by State Authorities in drawing up their State Plans and the same is applicable to di ff erent ministries and departments of the Government of India for the purpose of integrating the measures for prevention of disaster or the mitigation of its e ff ects in their development plans and projects. The  National  Institute  of  Disaster  Management  (NIDM)  has  to  follow  the  broad  policies  and guidelines set by the NDMA.

- 3.1.2  The  National  Executive  Committee,  under  the  Act  has  to  prepare  the  National  Plan, coordinate and monitor the implementation of the National Policy.
- 3.1.3 Similarly, the State Authority of each state has been given the responsibility for laying down policies and plans for disaster management for their state, under the Act.

## 3.2 National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM)

3.2.1 The National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM) has been approved by the central government on October 22, 2009 and circulated to all concerned. The policy envisages a safe and disaster resilient India by developing a holistic, proactive, multi-disaster oriented and technology driven strategy through a culture of prevention, mitigation, preparedness and response. The policy covers all aspects of disaster management including institutional and legal arrangements, fi nancial arrangements, disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness, techno-legal regime, response, relief and rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery, capacity development, knowledge management,  research and development. It focuses on the areas where action is needed and the institutional mechanism through which such action can be channelised.

3.2.2 The NPDM addresses the concerns of all the sections of the society including di ff erently abled  persons,  women,  children  and  other  disadvantaged  groups  in  terms  of  granting  relief and formulating measures for rehabilitation of the persons a ff ected by disasters. The issue of equity and inclusiveness has been accorded due consideration. It aims to bring in transparency and accountability in all aspects of disaster management through involvement of community, community based organisations, Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), local bodies and civil society.

## 3.3 National Plan on Disaster Management

3.3.1  An  institutional  mechanism for  preparation of the National Plan has been put in place, which is under preparation in three parts namely:-

- (i)     National Response Plan,
- (ii)    National Mitigation Plan and
- (iii)   National Capacity Building Plan.

3.3.2  A  Facilitation  Committee  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Secretary  (Border  Management) in  the  Ministry  of  Home  A ff airs  and  three  sub-committees  namely:  (i)  National  Response Plan Committee (ii) National Mitigation Plan Committee and (iii) National Capacity Building

## Disaster Management in India

Plan  Committee  have  been  constituted  for  preparation  of  the  National  Plan  on  Disaster Management.

3.3.3 The National Mitigation Plans are under preparation by the concerned nodal ministries for disasters in respect of which the Nodal Ministries have been identi fi ed and designated (Table 3.1).  The  Nodal  O ffi cers  of  the  ministries  concerned  with  the  disasters  are  the  conveners  of the National Mitigation Plan Committees and are required to complete the Mitigation Plan in consultation with the members concerned with the respective disasters in NDMA.

## 3.4  Focus and Objectives of Guidelines

NDMA is engaged in the formulation of guidelines through a consultative process involving multiple  stakeholders,  including  the  government,  non-government  organisations,  academic and scienti fi c institutions, the corporate sector and community. Since its inception, NDMA has so far released various disaster speci fi c and thematic guidelines. These may be visited at the site www.ndma.gov.in.  Salient features of the guidelines issued are as follows:-

- 3.4.1 Management of Landslide and Snow Avalanches: The objectives of these guidelines are to institutionalise the landslide hazard mitigation e ff orts, to make the society aware of the various aspects of landslide hazard in the country and to prepare the society to take suitable action to reduce both risks and costs associated with this hazard. The guidelines include regulatory and non-regulatory frameworks with de fi ned time schedules for all activities.
- 3.4.2 Management of Cyclones: The guidelines aim to deal with the tropical cyclones by way of appropriate coping strategies and risk reduction plans along with greater public awareness. The  guidelines  call  for  proactive,  participatory,  fail  safe,  multi-disciplinary  and  multi-sector approach  at  various  levels.  An  approach  encompassing  Early  Warning  System  on  cyclones, structural measures for preparedness and mitigation, covering cyclone shelters, buildings, road links, drains, embankments, communication/power transmission networks, and non-structural mitigation options, such as coastal zone management, coastal fl ood plain management, natural resources  management, awareness generation related to CDM, hazard zoning and mapping, including the use of GIS tools, capacity development, etc; and its implementation strategies are suggested.
- 3.4.3 Management of Earthquake: The guidelines emphasise that all new structures are built in  compliance  with  earthquake  resistant  building  codes. Town  planning,  bye-laws,  structural safety audits of existing lifeline structures and other critical structures in earthquake prone areas, carrying out selective seismic strengthening and retro fi tting ought to be addressed.
- 3.4.4 Management of Floods: The guidelines aim at measures for preparedness, prevention, mitigation in the prefl ood stage and on prompt and e ff ective response, relief and recovery during

## Disaster Management in India

- - and post fl ood stages.  Importance on non-structural measures besides structural measures is emphasized in the guidelines.  Setting of basin-wise organisations for fl ood management and also for setting up a National Flood Management Institute for training, education and research are suggested in the guideline.
- 3.4.5 Chemical  Disasters  (Industrial): These  guidelines  call  for  a  protective,  participatory, well-structured, fail-safe, multi-disciplinary and multi-structural approach at various levels.  On the basis of vulnerabilities and consequences of chemical accidents, the guidelines review the existing  regulatory  framework  and  practices  and  thus  propose  for  a  regulatory  framework, code of practices, capacity development, institutional framework, etc.  They further set out an approach for implementation of the guidelines.
- 3.4.6 Management  of  Chemical  (Terrorism)  Disasters: The  guidelines  focus  on  outlining the  preparedness  and  e ff orts  made  for  mitigating  the  chemical  terrorism,  the  act  of  violence perpetrated  to  achieve  professed  aims,  using  chemical  agents.    While  reviewing  the  existing legislations and regulatory framework, the guidelines identify the gaps and propose the measures required to fi ll  the  gaps  in  the  legislative  and  regulatory  frameworks.   They  also  deal  with  the aspects of surveillance measures for strengthening the intelligence in order to prevent intentional use of chemical agents.
- 3.4.7 Preparation  of  State  Disaster  Management  Plans: The  aim  of  the  state  DM  plan  is to  ensure  that  the  components  of  DM  are  addressed  to  facilitate  planning,  preparedness, operational,  coordination  and  community  participation.  The  guideline  suggests  outlays  for preparation of the plan to include the state pro fi le, vulnerability assessment and risk analysis, prevention measures, mainstreaming DM concerns into developmental plan and programme projects, preparedness measures, response and partnership with the other stakeholders besides providing for fi nancial arrangement.
- 3.4.8 Psycho-Social Support and Mental Health Services in Disasters: Disasters leave a trail of agony and a ff ect the survivors' mental health.  The guidelines on this subject outlay the entire gamut of psycho-social  support  and  mental  health  services  with  a  view  to  build  the  nation resilient to respond e ff ectively in all types of disasters.  The intent of these guidelines is to develop and integrate a holistic, coordinated and pro-active strategy for management of psycho-social support and mental health services after a disaster through a culture of prevention, mitigation and preparedness to generate a prompt and e ff ective response.
- 3.4.9 Medical Preparedness and Mass Casualty Management: A Mass Casualty Event (MCE) is  an  incident resulting in a number of victims large enough to disrupt the normal course of emergency and health care services. The guidelines for MCE focus on all aspects of medical preparedness  and  mass  casualty  management  with  emphasis  on  prevention,  mitigation preparedness,  relief  and  medical  response  etc.  They  aim  to  develop  a  rigorous  medical management framework to reduce the number of deaths during MCE.
- 3.4.10 Management of Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies: The overall objective of the guidelines is to implement the concept of prevention of nuclear and radiological emergencies. . In rare cases of their occurrence due to factors beyond human control, the guidelines suggest the emergency should be managed through certain pre-planned and established structural and non-structural measures to minimise risks to health, life and the environment.

- 3.4.11 Incident  Response  System: These  guidelines provide directions and  guidelines to central ministries and the states for an e ff ective and well coordinated response. They suggest a multi-disciplinary, and systematic approach to guide administrative mechanisms  at  all  levels  of  the  government  with  scope  for  participation  of  private  sector, NGOs,  PRIs  and  communities  to  work  together  seamlessly  in  the  response  activities.  The guidelines  are  applicable  to  the  management  of  all  incidents  -  natural  or  human-made. The  proposed  methodology  is  expected  to  be  equally  useful  for  handling  all  kinds  of incidents  such  as  terrorism  (Counter  Insurgency),  law  and  order  situations,  serial  bomb blast,  hijacking,  air  accidents,  chemical,  biological,  radiological  and  nuclear  (CBRN)  disasters, mine disaster, port and harbour emergencies, forest fi res, oil fi eld fi res and oil spills.
- 3.4.12 Strengthening  of  Safety  and  Security  for  Transportation  of  POL  tankers: The guidelines  envisage  measures  for  prevention  and  for  adoption  of  preparedness  practices  to a level that there is no chance of error. This calls for fi rming up the regulations, setting up of mechanisms of strict conformation, as well as fail proof functioning by each role player.
- 3.4.13 Management  of  Biological  Disaster: The  guidelines  for  management  of  biological disasters focus on all aspects of Biological Disaster Management (BDM) including Bio-terrorism (BT). It emphasises a preventive approach such as immunisation of fi rst responders and stockpiles of  medical  countermeasures  based  upon  risk  reduction  measures  by  developing  a  rigorous medical management framework to reduce the number of deaths during biological disasters, both  intentional  and  accidental.  These  include  the  development  of  specialised  measures pertaining to the management of biological disasters.
- 3.4.14 Management  of  Tsunami :The  guidelines  present  an  introductory  overview  on  the tsunami risk and vulnerability in the country and the preparedness as a nation.  It provides for structural mitigation measures and lay down strategies for protecting lifeline with the sea front besides laying down the guidance for developing the techno legal regime and giving an account of various tool kits for tsunami risk management.
- 3.4.15 Role  of  NGOs  in  Disaster  Management: The  guidelines  discuss  the  role  of  NGOs  in disaster preparedness, mitigation and response and spell out the institutional mechanism for improving the e ff ectiveness of disaster management through e ff ective coordination between NGOs and the government at di ff erent levels.
- 3.4.16 Urban  Flooding: The guidelines aim to develop plans for the management of urban fl ooding with a view to guide the ministry and other government bodies for preparation of their disaster management plans on this aspect of disaster, recurrent in urban areas during monsoon. While reviewing the existing international and national practices for the design and maintenance of the urban drainage system, it addresses the issue of urban fl ood risk, vulnerability analysis and hazard mapping and provides for response action.
- 3.4.17 Management of Dead in the Aftermath of Disaster: These  guidelines  are  aimed  at institutionalising the standard procedure for proper management of dead bodies and animal carcasses in the aftermath of disasters.
- 3.4.18 Plan to counter threats to Municipal Water Supply and Water Reservoirs : The plan aims  to  counter  any  threat  to  municipal  water  supply  and  water  reservoir  in  view  of  such  a

## Disaster Management in India

perception and taking into account the present water supply system and legislative framework. The plan suggests to framing a preparedness plan and also outlining the guidelines for a standard operating plan.

3.4.19 NDMA from time to time has also been organizing workshops on di ff erent issues related to disasters and publishing its reports for action by concerned Ministry or agency. Such reports are given as under

- (i) Training regime for disaster response: The key to e ffi ciency in disaster response does not lie  in  good  equipment but in e ff ective  ongoing training of NDRF personnel. .  The report  on  the  training  regime  is  the  outcome  of  detailed  needs  analysis,  followed  by extensive research on good practices in disaster response training in vogue within the country and elsewhere in the world.  The training regime so devised aims to help the process of capacity building of NDRF for e ffi cient and e ff ective discharge of its onerous responsibility.
- (ii) Pandemic  Preparedness: The  outcome  of  the  workshop  held  on  the  subject  on  2122 nd April,  2008  deals  with  the  existing  status  of  preparedness  at  di ff erent  levels  of  the government and attached o ffi ces and inter-dependency of the sectors. The report presents the recommendations following two days of deliberations, on the subject.
- (iii) Revamping  of  Civil  Defence  set  up  in  the  country: The  changing  scenario,  reducing changes and occurrence of traditional wars, an steadily and increasing threat from natural and man- made disasters, with large scale devastation of life and property, warrants a greater role on the part of Civil Defence from merely hostile act-centric responsibility to a holistic role in all the facets of disaster management in the country. It recommends revamping the existing structure of civil defence for enhancing its functional responsibilities in realistic and cost e ff ective manner.

## 3.5  Management of Droughts 26

- 3.5.1 The new manual for drought management is jointly prepared by MOA &amp; NIDM and issued in November 2009. It suggests a system for drought management policy and programmes to be followed by the Government of India and state governments. It focuses on the general and common elements of drought management at the national level, while allowing the states to include their speci fi c schemes and interventions. The manual incorporates drought forecasting, monitoring, response and mitigation as a continuum of activities.
- 3.5.2  The  manual  is  divided  into  following  sections,  namely  -  understanding  drought,    its monitoring,  declaration  of  drought,  providing  relief  and  measures  taken  for  mitigation  of drought.  While  classifying  the  droughts  of  di ff erent  types  and  associated  vulnerability,  the guidelines suggests the measures for management of drought.  The guidelines lay emphasis on risk management rather than following the traditional approach of crisis management as a reactive response measure.  The vital components of drought management namely, drought intensity  assessment,  it's  declaration,  prioritisation  of  areas  of  drought  management  and implementation of drought management strategy are outlined in the guidelines. The manual may  also  be  visited  on  NDMA's  website  at  the    link  :  http://ndma.gov.in/ndma/guidelines/ NDMA\_Droughtguidelines.pdf

## 3.6 National Action Plan on Climate Change

3.6.1  On  June  30,  2008,  Prime  Minister  Dr.  Manmohan  Singh  released  India's fi rst  National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), outlining existing and future policies and programs addressing climate mitigation and adaptation.  The plan identi fi es eight core 'national missions' running through 2017 and directs ministries to submit detailed implementation plans to the Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change by December 2008.

3.6.2 Emphasizing the overriding priority of maintaining high economic growth rates to raise living  standards,  the  plan  'identi fi es  measures  that  promote  our  development  objectives while  also  yielding  co-bene fi ts  for  addressing  climate  change  e ff ectively.'   It  stipulates  that these national measures would be more successful with assistance from developed countries, and pledges that India's per capita greenhouse gas emissions 'will at no point exceed that of developed countries even as we pursue our development objectives.' The plan can be visited on the website of Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF)

## 3.8 Conclusion

The policy and guidelines are only illustrative. The concerned Ministries related to DM activities, either have come out with their own policy, plans and regulatory mechanisms for management of disasters pertaining to their domain or are at di ff erent stages of its formulations. It is hoped that by going through the details of the available policy and the guidelines and other information at  one place, the other ministries, states and the stakeholders may get necessary inputs and guidance  to  use them and come up with e ff ective and implementable plans at their level.

## 4.1 Introduction

The Yokohama message emanating from the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction in May 1994 underlined the need for an emphatic shift in the strategy for disaster mitigation. It  inter-alia  stressed  that  disaster  prevention,  mitigation,  preparedness  and  relief  were  four elements, which contribute to and gain from the implementation of the sustainable development policies.  These elements along with environmental protection and sustainable development, are closely inter related.  Nations, therefore should incorporate them in their development plans and ensure e ffi cient follow up measures at the community, sub-regional, regional, national and international levels.  Disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness are better than disaster response in achieving the goals and objectives of vulnerability reduction.

It  would  be  evident  from  the  table  given  in  4.1  that  if  we  compare  the  disasters  of  similar magnitude in USA and Japan with that of India it is found that the loss of lives in USA and Japan are much less as compared to that of India. The factors in fl uencing reduced loss is attributed to the better preparedness in USA and Japan.

## 4.2 Mainstreaming of Disaster Risk Reduction in Developmental Strategy

4.2.1 Prevention  and  mitigation  contribute  to  lasting  improvement  in  safety  and  should  be integrated in the disaster management. The Government of India has adopted mitigation and prevention as essential components of their development strategy. Accordingly, the Tenth Five Year  Plan  document  has  a  detailed  chapter  on  disaster  management.   The  plan  emphasises the  fact  that  development  cannot  be  sustainable  without  mitigation  being  built  into  the developmental process.

## Disaster Management in India

- 4.2.2 Mainstreaming  DRR  involves  incorporating  disaster  risk  reduction  into  development policy and practice. It means radically expanding and enhancing disaster risk reduction so that it  becomes normal practice, fully institutionalised within an agency's relief and development agenda. Mainstreaming has three purposes:
- (a) To make certain that all the development programmes and projects that  originate from or are funded by an agency, are designed with evident consideration for potential disaster risks and to resist hazard impact,
- (b) To make certain that all the development programmes and projects that originate from or are funded by an agency, do not inadvertently increase vulnerability to disaster in all sectors: social, physical, economic and environment,
- (c) To make certain that all the disaster relief and rehabilitation programmes and projects that originate from or are funded by an agency are designed to contribute to developmental aims and to reduce future disaster risk.
- 4.2.3 Mainstreaming DRR into the developmental plans is an important mandate of the Disaster Management Act 2005. Integration of disaster risk reduction measures into ongoing fl agship programmes of Government of India is being used as an entry point for mainstreaming DRR in  development  plans.  Steps  for  ensuring  the  incorporation  of  DRR  into  various  ongoing programmes\plans are as follows:
- (a) Identi fi cation of key programme/projects of Government of India,
- (b) Identi fi cation of entry points within the programme for integration of DRR (structural, nonstructural and other mitigation measures) at various levels viz. national, state and district levels,
- (c) Close coordination with concerned departments such as State Planning Commission and Finance Department for promoting DRR measures into development plans and policies,
- (d) Advocacy for allocation of dedicated budget for DRR within the departmental plans,
- (e) Preparation of guidelines for integration of disaster risk reduction measures into development plans of various departments at the district and sub-district levels.
- 4.2.4 Mainstreaming of National Plan and its Sub-Plan: Three  committees  constituted  by Government of India are working for preparing the National Response Plan, National Human Resource and Capacity Development Plan and Mitigation Plans by respective ministries who have been designated as nodal agencies for the disaster relating to their activities.  The draft National Response Plan and National Human Resource and Capacity Development Plan are ready.  Certain recti fi cations and modi fi cations are underway before it is presented to the National Executive Committee for its approval.

4.2.5  It  is  expected  that  National  Response  Plan  will  be  put  in  place  once  it  is  adopted  by Government of India.  It will pave the way for institutionalising the response plan at three tiers as envisaged in the Disaster Management Act.

- 4.2.6  Similarly,  the  Capacity  Development  Plan,  once  approved  and  adopted  will  provide  a roadmap for undertaking the capacity building for people engaged in di ff erent facets of disaster management  and  enhance  the  capacity  at  the  individual,  organizational  as  well  as  at  the environmental levels.

4.2.7 Mitigation  Plans  have  been  submitted  by  the  ministries  of  Defence,  Mines  (Geological survey  of  India),  Department  of  Atomic  Energy,  Department  of  Agriculture  &amp;  Cooperation, Railways and Water Resources, which are under examination and fi nalization.  It is expected that once these mitigation plans are approved, the concerned ministry will undertake activities for taking the prevention and mitigation measures to address the hazard and risk involved in the activities  of  their  sector.  It  would  be  the  endeavor  of  the  government to persuade the other ministries who have yet to bring their Mitigation Plans at the draft stage to take it further for approval and adoption.

## 4.3 National Disaster Mitigation Fund:

4.3.1 Section  47  of  the  Disaster  Management  Act  2005  provides  for  constitution  of  National Disaster Mitigation Fund. The provisions of the Act are as under:

- (a) The Central Government may, by noti fi cation in the O ffi cial  Gazette, constitute a fund to be  called  the  National  Disaster  Mitigation  Fund  (NDMF)  for  projects  exclusively  for  the purpose of mitigation and there shall be credited thereto such amount which the Central Government may, after due appropriation made by parliament by law in this behalf.
- (b) The National Disaster Mitigation Fund shall be applied by the National Disaster Management Authority.

4.3.2  The  modalities  of  constitution  of  NDMF  have  been  discussed  by  MHA  with  the  MoF, Planning  Commission  and  NDMA  from  time  to  time.  A  reference  was  made  to  13 th Finance Commission. The 13 th Finance Commission has given its report and as per its recommendations: 'Mitigation  and  reconstruction  activities  should  be  kept  out  of  the  schemes  funded  through Finance Commission grants and met out of overall development plan funds of the centre and the states. ' The issue is under consideration of Ministry of Home A ff airs with other concerned Ministries.

## 4.4. Measures taken for Prevention and Mitigation of Hazards

Risk of destruction and casualties associated with di ff erent disasters can substantially be reduced by introduction of prevention and mitigation measures. Mitigation is generally categorised into two main types of activities i.e. structural and non-structural. Structural mitigation refers to any physical construction to reduce or avoid possible impacts of hazards, which include engineering measures  and  construction  of  hazard-resistant  protective  structures  and  infrastructure.  Nonstructural mitigation refers to policies, awareness, knowledge development, public commitment, and methods and operating practices, including participatory mechanisms and the provision of information, which can reduce risk with related impacts. The Government of India has adopted several mitigation measures for reducing the risk of being a ff ected by disasters. These measures are being implemented by the concerned ministries. Some of these initiatives are described below.

## 4.5 Earthquakes

4.5.1  India  has  been  divided  into fi ve  seismic  zones  according  to  the  maximum  intensity  of earthquakes expected. Of these, zone V is most active and comprises whole of Northeast India, the northern portion of Bihar, western Uttar Pradesh hills, Himachal Pradesh and Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands.

4.5.2 Pace of Urbanisation in India has been increasing. Many of the cities and townships including the national capital of New Delhi, are located in zones of high seismic risk. Typically, the majority of  the  constructions  in  these  cities  are  not  earthquake  resistant.  Regulatory  mechanisms  are

## Disaster Management in India

weak, thus any earthquake striking in one of these cities would turn into a major disaster. Six major earthquakes have struck di ff erent parts of India over a span of last 15 years. The following measures have been initiated for prevention and mitigation of such disasters:

4.5.3 National Earthquake Risk Mitigation Project (NERMP): Understanding the importance of the management of such hazardous situations caused by the earthquake, the Government of  India  has  taken  a  national  initiative  for  launching  a  project  of 'National  Earthquake  Risk Mitigation Project (NERMP). The proposed project aims at strengthening the structural and nonstructural earthquake mitigation e ff orts and reducing the vulnerability in the high risk districts prone to earthquakes. Necessary risk mitigation measures are proposed to be put in place in the highly seismic zones. NDMA, tasked with this project has prepared a Detailed Project Report (DPR) which is under consultation with all the stakeholders. The proposed components of the project include techno-legal regime, institutional strengthening, capacity building and public awareness etc.

4.5.4 National Building Code (NBC): The National Building Code of India (NBC), a comprehensive building  code,  is  a  national  instrument  providing  guidelines  for  regulating  the  building construction activities across the country. The NBC was fi rst published in 1970 at the instance of Planning Commission and was revised in 1983. Thereafter three major amendments, two in 1987 and the third in 1997 were issued. Considering a series of further developments in the fi eld of building construction, including the lessons learnt in the aftermath of number of natural calamities like devastating earthquakes and super cyclones, a project for comprehensive revision of NBC was taken up under the aegis of National Building Code Committee.  The revised NBC has now been brought out as National Building Code of India 2005 (NBC 2005). The salient features of the revised NBC include meeting the challenges posed by natural calamities and re fl ecting the state-of-the-art and contemporary applicable international practices. The code may be accessed at http://www.bis.org.in/sf/nbc.htm.

## Box 4.1: Building collapse in Lalita Park, Laxmi Nagar, Delhi

There was an incidence of building collapse in Lalita Park, Laxmi Nagar, East Delhi on 15 th November 2010. Several people lost their life and many injured in this incidence. Lt. Governor of National Capital Delhi appointed an inquiry commission by exercising of the power conferred by section 3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 (60 of 1952) and read with the Noti fi cation No. F.2/4/66-UT dated 20 th August, 1966, issued by Govt. of India, Ministry of Home A ff airs.

Single member, namely, Sh. Lokeshwar Prasad, retired Justice of Delhi High Court has been appointed.

The terms of reference of the Commission is as under:-

- 1. to determine the immediate and proximate causes for the collapse of the building,
- 2. to determine the circumstances and sequences of events leading to the collapse of the building,
- 3. to fi x responsibility, both individual and institutional, for the collapse of this building and for the building already built that are unsafe structurally in East Delhi,
- 4. to  determine  the  administrative,  procedural  and  statutory  lapses  of  various  departments  and agencies to evaluate structural safety aspects of buildings already built or proposed to be built in East Delhi and to recommend remedial measures,
- 5. to  recommend  measures  that  will  combat  corruption  and  make  concerted  public  servant accountable for construction of unsafe building.

It is expected the commission will come out with recommendations, which may be useful for framing policy and action to contain such mishaps in future.

Jammu &amp; Kashmir Earthquake 2005- Retro fi tting on walls and windows

4.5.5  E ff ective  implementation  of  these  codes  has  been  a  challenge.  The  Bureau  of  Indian Standards &amp; National Design and Research Forum with the Institute of Engineers have organised series  of  brainstorming  sessions  and  workshops  to  pave  the  way  to  inculcate  the  same  into practice. As part of their continuous e ff orts, a workshop has been scheduled in the month of in May 2011 titled 'Implementation of Standards in Infrastructural Development' .

4.5.6 E ff orts by Building Materials &amp; Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC): The BMTPC undertook projects for retro fi tting of life-line structures for generating awareness among the people as well as various government agencies about the need and techniques of retro fi tting. The Council has initiated retro fi tting of MCD school buildings in Delhi. It has further initiated a study of 250 bedded hall of Bara Hindu Rao Hospital, New Delhi. It has earlier carried out seismic  strengthening  and  retro fi tting  of  the  sub-district  hospital  in  Kupwara  in  Jammu  &amp; Kashmir, 442 structures in Gujarat and primary school buildings at Thano, Block Raipur and Dehradun. The  experience  on  these  retro fi tted  buildings  is  aimed  to  help  people  at  large and the policy makers in particular in working towards reducing the vulnerability of lakhs of existing public and private buildings, thereby protecting most number of people in case of future earthquakes.

4.5.7 Earthquake and Seismic Zones: The entire Indian landmass, susceptible to di ff erent levels of earthquake hazards, referred to as Zone II to V as per the Seismic Zoning Map of India contained in IS 1893:2002 Fifth Revision.

Multi-purpose Cyclone Shelter, Kendrapada, Orissa

<!-- image -->

The general basis of the zones is as follows:

Zone V: Covers the areas liable to seismic intensity 1X and above on MSK (1964) Intensity scale. This is the most severe seismic zone and is referred here as Very High Damage Risk Zone.

Zone IV: Gives the area liable to MSK VIII. This zone is second in severity to zone V. This referred here as High Damage Risk Zone.

Zone III: The associated intensity is MSK VII. This is termed here as moderate Damage Risk Zone.

Zone II: The probable intensity is MKS VII. This zone is referred to as Low Damage Risk Zone.

Note: In the revision of the Seismic Zone Map given earlier in the Vulnerability Atlas of India 1997, the seismic zone I has now been merged into Seismic Zone II and renamed as Zone II, Zone III has been extended to cover more areas in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Zones IV and V have remained unchanged.

It  may be mentioned here that the new intensity scale, called as MSK Intensity Scale 1964, is much more detailed  and  quantitative  in  nature  as  compared  to  the  Modi fi ed  Mercalli  (MM) though almost similar in intensity. Hence MSK has been  used in place of MM in the  classi fi cation of the seismic zones given above

4.5.8 Initiative by Ministry of Panchayati Raj: It releases funds under Backward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF) for meeting critical infrastructural gaps and other developmental requirements. The ministry has fi nanced several district plans under the BRGF for construction of panchayat buildings,  anganwadi centres, school buildings, class rooms, roads, bridges, culverts etc. and restructuring of State Institutes for Rural Development (SIRD) buildings, block resource centres, panchayat training centers etc. The ministry, vide its letter No. N-11012/35/2007- P&amp;J, dated 2 nd February 2010 has advised all the states that it is imperative for all such structures to be made disaster resilient in the line with the national vision of disaster management.

## 4.6 Cyclones

4.6.1 National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP) Initiative: Recurrent cyclones account for a large number of deaths, loss of livelihood opportunities, loss of public and private property, and severe damage to infrastructure, thus reversing the developmental gains whenever disasters occur. In order to reduce the loss of life and properties in the events of future calamities, the NCRMP has been launched by MHA in three phases in the cyclone prone coastal states and Union Territories, keeping in view the vulnerability of the states and their readiness with investment proposals.

## Box 4.2: National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project

4.6.2 Integrated  Coastal  Zone  Management  Project  (ICZMP): The  Government  of  India under the  aegis  of  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forest  (MoEF)  has  launched  the  ICZMP . The objective of the project is to assist GoI in building the national capacity for implementation of a  comprehensive  coastal  management  approach  in  the  country  and  piloting  the  integrated coastal zone management approach in states of Gujarat, Orissa and West Bengal.

## Box 4.3: Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project

## There are four components of this project:

- (i) Capacity  Building: It  includes  mapping,  delineation  and  demarcation  of  the  hazard  lines,  and delineation of coastal sediment cells all along the mainland coast of India.
- (ii) Piloting ICZM approaches in Gujarat: This component will support capacity building of the state level agencies and institutions, including preparation of an ICZM plan for the coastal sediment cell that includes the Gulf of Kachchh and pilot investments.

- (iii) Piloting ICZM approaches in Orissa: It  provides for capacity building of the state level agencies and institutions, including preparation of an ICZM plan for the coastal sediment cells that include the stretches of Paradip-Dhamra and Gopalpur-Chilika, including a regional coastal process study, and pilot investments.
- (iv) Piloting ICZM approaches in West Bengal: The project cost is ' 1425 crores ($285.67 million) and it is slated to be completed by 31 Dec. 2015.

## 4.7 Floods

- 4.7.1 National  Flood  Risk  Mitigation  Project  (NFRMP): NFRMP  has  been  envisaged  for mitigation or reduction in risk, severity or consequences of fl oods. It aims at ensuring that arrangements are in place to mobilise the resources and capability for relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction  and  recovery  from  disasters  besides  creating  awareness  among  vulnerable communities. NDMA has been entrusted to prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) on Flood Risk Mitigation Project.
- 4.7.2 Flood  Management  Programme: The state governments  are  engaged  in fl ood management work since the independence of the country.  Upto the Tenth Five Year Plan, 45.6 million hectares (m-ha.) of fl ood prone areas in the country had been provided a reasonable degree of protection.  The Eleventh Five Year Plan envisages protecting an additional area of 2.18  million  hectares.  Management  of  water  resources  is  primarily  the  responsibility  of  the state governments.  The schemes for Flood Control and Protection are therefore, to be planned, funded and executed by the state governments. The Government of India, under the aegis of Ministry of Water Resources has launched the 'Flood Management Programme (FMP)' at a total cost of ' 8000 crores for the 11 th Plan period (2007-12).

## Box 4.4: Flood Management Programme

Background: The FMP scheme was launched by Ministry of Water Resources under the central plan at a total cost of ' 8000 crores. The sanction of the scheme was been conveyed vide MoWR Order No. 5/7/2006-Ganga (Vol.II) / 4749-77 dated 28.11.2007.

Aim: The  scheme  provides fi nancial  assistance  to  the  state  governments  for  undertaking fl ood management works in critical areas during the 11th Plan period (2007-12).

## Components:

- (i) Critical fl ood control and river management works in the entire country (includes river management, fl ood  control,  anti-erosion,  drainage  development,  anti-sea  erosion,  and fl ood  proo fi ng  works besides fl ood prone area development programme in critical regions and restoration of damaged fl ood control/ management works).
- (ii) The spillover works of on-going central plan schemes of X th Plan would also be supported under this scheme during XI Plan.

Executing Authority: The  FMP  scheme  has  been  implemented  by  Flood  Control, Water  Resources  / Irrigation Departments of the state governments.

Under the programme, a total of 311 fl ood management work schemes of critical nature are included from 19 States for central assistance up to 31st March, 2010, out of which 117 works for 10 States are reported to be physically complete.  It is expected that 1.33 billion hectares of fl ood prone areas have thus been restored and protected which will provide safety to about 12.89 million people during high fl oods.

## Disaster Management in India

4.7.3 For the year 2010-11, another 42 new fl ood management schemes have been included under the FMP from Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, J&amp;K, Kerala, Manipur, Orissa, Pondicherry, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, U.P. and West Bengal.

## 4.8 Study of Land Contour by GSI

4.8.1 Geological  Survey  of  India  (GSI)  studied  the  shape  and  material  of  the  land  getting inundated  and  generates  data  on  area,  shape,  slope,  in fi ltration  and  permeability  of  soil  of the basin, drainage pattern, landform and longitudinal and cross pro fi les of the channels. On the basis of these studies, GSI produces fl ood hazard maps indicating prohibitive, Restricted, Cautionary and Flood Free Zones.

4.8.2 Signi fi cant fl ood related studies and recommendations made by GSI are as follows

- · Brahmaputra  Valley  -  A  comprehensive  geo-environmental  database  for  environmental management and fl ood control generated,
- · Lower Banas sub-basin- selective irrigation to prevent rise of ground water table recommended,
- · Kandi basin West Bengal- GSI recommended construction of small weirs to reduce impact of fl ood,
- · Mokameh Tal area in the Ganga Flood Plain- rejuvenation of existing drainage channels to reduce fl ood problem recommended,
- · Lower Damodar Basin- diversion along artificial canals and re-excavation of old river channel recommended,
- · Landslide zonation map for Himalayan region,
- · The contribution of snow melting to annual flood.

GSI's fl ood related studies are used by Central Water Commission, Water Resource Development Project Authorities, Urban and Rural Planning Authorities, Ministry of Environment and Forest and Ministry of Agriculture etc.

## 4.9 Landslides

In view of challenges caused by landslides, the 'National Landslide Risk Mitigation Project' (NLRMP) has been proposed to be launched. It aims at strengthening the structural and non-structural landslide mitigation  e ff orts,  reducing  the landslide  risk  and  vulnerability in the hilly districts prone  to landslides  and  mud fl ows  and minimise the risks arising out of disasters in landslides. NDMA has  been  entrusted  to  prepare

## 4.10 Tsunami

4.10.1 The Tsunami of 26 th December 2004 caused extensive damage to life and property in the States of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and UTs of Puducherry and Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands (A&amp;NI). It hit the fi shermen community badly besides their means of livelihood. There had also been extensive damage to the infrastructure including houses, harbors, jetties, roads, bridges, power, telecom, hospitals, schools and other social sector buildings after Tsunami in Samanthanpettai village Nagapattanam.

## Box 4.5:  Measures by Japan

Japan,  where  tsunami  science  and  response  measures fi rst  began  following  disaster  in  1896.  The country has built many tsunami walls of up to 4.5 meters (15ft) to protect the populated coastal areas. Other  localities  have  built fl oodgates  and  channels  to  redirect  the  water  from  incoming  tsunami. However,  their  e ff ectiveness  has  been  questioned,  as  tsunami  often  overtops  the  barriers.  For instance, the Okushiri Hokkaido tsunami which struck Okushiri Island of Hokkaido within two to fi ve minutes of the earthquake on July 12, 1993 created waves as high as 30 meters (100ft) tall - as high as a 10-storey building. The port town on Aonae was completely protected by tsunami wall, but the waves washed right over the wall and destroyed all the wood-framed structures in the area. The wall may have succeeded in slowing down and moderating the height of tsunami, but it did not prevent major destruction and loss of lives.

where Tsunami struck in 2004 remained almost intact because the existing coconut palms and mangroves trees absorbed the tsunami's energy. Similarly, the village of Naluvedapathy in Tamil Nadu region faced minimal damage and few deaths because of the forest of 80, 244 trees planted along the shoreline in 2002

## 4.11 Droughts

4.11.1  The  Department  of  Agriculture  &amp;  Cooperation,  under  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture, Government of India released a manual for drought management in November, 2009.  The manual  suggests  for  looking  beyond  the  traditional  drought  management  through  famine codes for dealing with situations of mass hunger and collective penury.  It focuses on plans which take into account all capabilities of the state to address the impact of drought i.e., focus on mitigation measures, tapping newer technologies, enabling the systems adapt to the new legal framework and including improvement and area development programmes in drought mitigation.

4.11.2  The  National  Institute  of  Agriculture  and  Extension  (MANAGE),  Hyderabad  has  been identi fi ed to launch a National Project for Integrated Drought Monitoring &amp; Management, with MANAGE as the lead partner. A proposal submitted by MANAGES to implement this national project through available budgetary provisions of Department of Agriculture &amp; Cooperation is under consideration. Another proposal to set up a National Institute of Drought Management is also under consideration of Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Cooperation.

4.11.3 The Drought Prone Areas Programme (DPAP) and Desert Development Programme (DDP) are being implemented by the Government of India since 1973-74 and 1977-78 respectively. These programmes aim at drought proo fi ng and minimising deserti fi cation of fragile areas in

the arid, semi-arid and dry-sub humid regions often a ff ected by severe drought conditions and deserti fi cation.

4.11.4 National Rainfed Area Authority in the Ministry of Agriculture has been set up to address the issue of drought mitigation on a long term basis. It comprises experts who provide knowledge inputs regarding systematic upgradation and management of the country's dryland and rainfed agriculture.

- 4.11.5 The Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Cooperation has also undertaken some other measures to address the drought management including:
- · Implementation  of  water  harvesting  conservation,  artificial  recharge  of  ground  water, traditional  water  harvesting  and  conservation,  water  saving  technologies  like  drip  and sprinkler  irrigation  systems,  improved  water  saving  farm  practices,  long  term  irrigation management etc,
- · Working towards convergence of lessons learnt from studies carried out by multiple institutions working in related fi elds such as Central Research Institute for Dry land Agriculture (CRIDA), International Crop Research for Semi-arid Tropics (ICRISAT), India Meteorological Department (IMD), National Remote Sensing Centre  NRSC) and Indian Council for Agricultural Research ( (ICAR), etc,
- · Exploring  practices  such  as  harvesting  cereal  crops  for  fodder,  supplemental  irrigation  if feasible, and ensuring availability of seeds when alternative crops are bene fi cial with logistic support from state and district machineries,
- · Maximising efficient use of available surface and groundwater in drought prone areas i.e. to resort  to  drip  and  sprinkler  practices  wherever  possible,  particularly  for  commercial  crops including fruit orchards,
- · Undertaking  construction  of  water  shed  structures  at  the  right  place  to  enhance  water recharge  for  life  saving  irrigation  at  critical  stages  of  crop  growth  and  during  drought situations, and
- · Using optimally the services of Village Resources Centre established by Indian Space Research Organisation, ICAR, State Agriculture University and other organisations towards management of drought.

## 4.12 Fire

4.12.1 A Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Strengthening of Fire and Emergency Service in the country was launched in November 2009 at an outlay of ' 200 crores. The overall objective of the scheme is to strengthen fi re and emergency services in the country and progressively transform it into Multi-Hazard Response Force capable of acting as fi rst responder in all types of emergency situations.  As  the  scheme  is  to  be  implemented  with  the  centre  and  state  contributions  for procurement of equipment (in the ratio of 75:25 and for north-eastern states in the ratio of 90:10) within the XI th Five Year Plan period, the state governments are to contribute ' 40.23 crore as their share.

## 4.13  Forest Fire Management:

4.13.1  Fire  prevention,  detection  and  suppression  activities  are  state  subjects.    The  Central Government has been formulating policy, planning and fi nancing the states from time to time. Forest Protection Division of Ministry of Forests headed by DIG of Forests is responsible for the forest fi re management at the central level.  The Joint Forest Management Committees, 36,165 in number across the country, have been given the responsibility to protect the forests from fi res. The Central Government has issued the National Forest Fire, Prevention and Control guidelines and has also worked on a National Master Plan on Forest Fire Control.

4.13.2 A centrally sponsored scheme 'Intensi fi cation of Forest Management' initiated since the Tenth Five Year Plan has allocated 15 percent of the funds for forest fi re management.

## 4.14 Oil Industry

In  the  oil  industry,  the  disaster  management  plan  is  maintained  at  the  area  level  and  covers a wide aspect (since their activities are likely to a ff ect local people also). Oil companies have established their Crisis Management Plan at the company level and at the HQ level also with specialist to deal with fi res and other identi fi ed hazards. In oil companies, it has been observed that international players for rescue and recovery operations are also hired at very short notice at cater to the speci fi c requirements.

## 4.15 Chemical Disasters

The MOEF has taken the following measures towards developing a Regulatory Framework for Chemical Safety:

- (i) The Environment (Protection) Act was enacted in 1986. Under the Act, two rules have been noti fi ed for ensuring chemical safety, namely,
- (a) The  Manufacture,  Storage  and  Import  of  Hazardous  Chemicals  Rules,  1989  (MSIHC) amended in 1994 and 2000;
- (b) The  Chemical  Accidents  (Emergency,  Planning,  Preparedness,  and  Response)  Rules, 1996 (EPPR) under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
- (ii) The Public Liability Insurance Act 1991, amended in 1992 and the Public Liability Insurance Rules 1991, amended in 1993 require maximum hazard units to procure an insurance policy and deposit an equal amount in the Environment Relief Fund to provide immediate relief to victims of chemical accidents.

## 4.16 Prevention of Disasters in Mines

The various safeguards and preventive measures against coal mine fi res are outlined in the Coal Mines Regulations, 1957 and related circulars, noti fi cations and technical instructions. The Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) examines from  each and every application for underground and surface mining from all considerations. Wherever necessary the DGMS imposes additional precautionary and preventive measures. The o ffi cers  of  the  DGMS from time to time inspect the mines to assess the implementation of the measures and suggest modi cations, etc. fi

For the new projects and reorganisational projects, after the issuance of the EIA Noti fi cation, 1994  under  the  Environment  (protection)  Act,  1986,  it  has  become  compulsory  to  get

environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) and for this the mines are required to develop their Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) in which the problems of the mine fi res are adequately addressed as the mine fi res have considerable environmental impacts.

## 4.17 Epidemics

4.17.1 The Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare is instrumental and responsible for implementation of  various  programmes  on  a  national  scale  in  the  areas  of  prevention  and  control  of  major communicable diseases  and  promotion  of  traditional  and  indigenous  systems  of  medicines. This  ministry  also  assists  states  in  preventing  and  controlling  the  spread  of  seasonal  disease outbreaks and epidemics through technical assistance. It is actively involved in disease diagnosis during epidemics and outbreaks, operational research, manpower development, advisory role and  other  multifarious  activities  towards  prevention  and  control  of  a  cascade  of  epidemic prone  disease  of  larger  public  health  importance  in  collaboration  with  National  Institute  of Communicable Disease (NICD) and external organisations and institutes. (Photo : A health camp at Akkarapettai Villager in Nagapattinam District-December 2004)

4.17.2 Post-disaster management of health, sanitation and hygiene services is crucial to prevent an  outbreak  of  epidemics. The  draft  Public  Health  (Prevention,  Control  and  Management  of Epidemics, Bio-terrorism and Disasters) Bill prepared by the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare is under consideration for enactment.

4.17.3  National  Vector  Borne  Diseases  Control  Programme  (NVBDCP)  is  the  key  programme for prevention/control of outbreaks/epidemics of malaria, dengue, chikungunya etc., vaccines administered to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to diseases like measles, diphtheria, pertussis,  poliomyelitis  etc.  Two  key  measures  to  prevent/control  epidemics  of  water-borne diseases  like  cholera,  viral  hepatitis  etc.  include  making  available  safe  water  and  ensuring personal and domestic hygienic practices are adopted.

4.17.4 It is impossible to always prevent epidemics, but its impact can always be mitigated by anticipating  them  and  by  being  prepared.  Epidemic  preparedness  and  response  is  a  multisectoral and multi-agency activity. Health sector plays a lead role in preparing and executing the epidemic preparedness plan but need the expertise and support of other disciplines/sectors also.  Planning process will inter alia require  extensive review of health infrastructure, disease surveillance  and  response  system,  availability  of  laboratories,  trained  professionals,  drugs, vaccines  and  equipment  in  the  country,  communication  system,  coordinating  mechanism between di ff erent sectors and between the national and international agencies and legal issues.

4.17.5  Accordingly,  Govt.  of  India  launched  Integrated  Disease  Surveillance  Project  (IDSP)  in November 2004 to  strengthen  capacity  at  state/district  levels  to  detect  and  respond  to  the epidemics in early rising phase. Under the project, the district and states have been strengthened by providing additional technical manpower (epidemiologists, microbiologists, entomologists), training  of  rapid  response  teams  for  outbreak  investigation  and  control,  strengthening  of laboratories for detection of organisms causing epidemic prone diseases, and establishment of IT network for data compilation, dissemination and analysis. The states are at varying stages of implementation.

4.17.6 The key achievement of IDSP has been creation of capacity at sub-district/district/state levels to detect early warning signals and outbreaks of epidemic prone diseases so that they can

be responded early. They collect weekly surveillance data, monitor disease trends and investigate rising  in  cases.  About  85%  of  districts  are  reporting  these  data  to  Central  Surveillance  Unit through e-mail and more than 60% report through portal. The result is that states have detected and responded to more number of outbreaks after implementation of IDSP. For example, a total of 553 outbreaks were reported and responded to by states in 2008, 799 outbreaks in 2009 and 990 outbreaks in 2010. Earlier not many outbreaks were reported in the country by the States/ UTs.

4.17.7 Finally, a mention must be made about the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 which were adopted by the 58 th  World Health Assembly in May 2005 and came into force on 15 June 2007 (in India on 8 August 2007). IHR (2005) also provide us an opportunity to strengthen core  capacities  to  detect,  assess  and  notify  and  control  all  public  health  emergencies  of international concern (PHEIC). These capacities will also help us to control endemic infectious diseases which may not spread to other countries.

## 4.18 Measures taken for Rail Safety

Several measures have been taken to improve safety of Rail Transportation which is summarised as below:

4.18.1 Special Railway Safety Fund (SRSF): Arising out of an important recommendation of Railway Safety Review Committee (RSRC) (Khanna Committee), to pull up the backlog of arrears for track renewals, bridges, rolling stock and signaling gear within a fi xed time frame, a nonlapsable 'Special Railway Safety Fund' of ' 17000 crores was set up with e ff ect from 01.10.2001 with a contribution from the Ministry of Finance and Railways. Works related to replacement / renewal of over-aged bridges, signaling gears and replacement of narrow gauge locomotives is ongoing.

4.18.2 Corporate  Safety  Plan  (2003-2013 ): Railway  Safety  Review  Committee  (1998),  in its report  recommended  that  railways  formulate  a  safety  plan  with  the  following  broad objectives:

- · To achieve reduction in rate of accidents per million train kilometers from  0.44 (in 2002-03) to 0.17 by the year 2013,
- · Implement measures to reduce chances of passenger fatality substantially in consequential train accidents by 2013,
- · Focus on development of manpower through major improvements in working environment and training to reduce the accidents attributable to human failure by 40 percent by 2013,
- · Achieve  safety  culture  on  all  fronts  including  maintenance  depots,  worksites,  stations, controls etc.,
- · Progressively achieve an environment of 'fail-proof' from the present 'fail-safe' system of asset failures by upgrading the systems by 2013, and
- · Prioritisation of safety related projects.

It is estimated that index of accidents per million train kilometers would be reduced from 0.44 (in 2002-03) to 0.17 in 2012-13. Similarly, the performance indices targets have been laid down for track defects, coach defects/ failures, wagon detachments/ failure, poor brake power (goods), incidence of train parting (goods), motive power defects, signal defects/ failures, communication failures and OHE (Overhead Equipment) defects.

4.18.3 Measures taken to reduce Derailments: Several measures have been taken to reduce the derailment such as

- · Replacement of over-aged tracks, bridges, gears and rolling stock,
- · Gradual phasing out of derailment prone four wheeler tank wagons,
- · Reduction in Thermit welded joints on rails, use of SPURT Cars for rail flaw detection,
- · Track circulation for enhanced safety in train operations,
- · Introduction of Self Propelled Accident Relief Medical Van (SPARMV) and Wheel Impact Load Detector (WILD).

4.18.4 Measures taken to reduce Collisions; Similarly several measures are under implementation for reducing the incidents of collision which may be summarised such as;

- · Extensive training to train operations staff
- · Improved maintenance and safety checks
- · Improvement in design of rolling stocks
- · Installation of Anti Collision Device (ACD).  ACD has been installed on 1900 Route kms. of Northeast  Frontier  Railway  Railway  and  800  route  kms.  on  Konkan  Railway  Corporation Limited and put under trial.  Decision has been taken to extend ACD to Southern Railway, South Central Railway and South Western Railway on a trial basis.

4.18.5 Measures taken to reduce level crossing accidents : Railway track have been jig jagging across the country side have rendered vulnerability pro fi le of the people living near tracks very high. Following measures are underway to reduce accidents arising out of crossing them.

## Disaster Management in India

- · Social awareness programmes have been launched in rural areas through divisions,
- · Construction of Road Over Bridges (ROBs)/Road Under Bridges (RUBs) at level crossing with Train Vehicle Units (TVUs) &gt; 1 lakh, limited use subways to replace level crossings,
- · Manning of unmanned level crossings,
- · Interlocking and provision of phones at level crossing gates,
- · Trial of Train Actuated Warning Device (TAWD).

4.18.6 Measures taken to reduce fi re accidents: Following measures have been taken to reduce the fi re accidents,

- · Provision of fire retardant material in new coaches and retro-fitment in existing coaches,
- · Emergency exits have been introduced in coaches to reduce fatalities,
- · Provision of electrical fire sensing and extinguishing system in rolling stock and stationary installations,
- · Provision of electrical fire sensing and extra quashing system in rolling stock and stationary installations.

## 4.19. Road

4.19.1 The main thrust of accident prevention and control across the world has been on the four 'E's , namely,

- (i) Education
- (ii) Enforcement
- (iii) Engineering
- (iv Environment and Emergency care of road accident victims.
- 4.19.2 The  measures  taken  by  Government  of  India  to  reduce  the  risk  of  road  accidents  are summarised as follows:
- i. Road Engineering: These are design/speci fi cation related aspects of roads and highways to enhance road safety. The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is ensuring usage of road safety furniture and has taken a number of steps to enhance safety of road users. The safety measures are inbuilt in the projects during design, construction, operations and maintenance.
- ii. Enforcement: The  state  governments and UTs are to take measures for enforcing the statutory provisions provided under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989. The enforcement measures under the said statute provides for inspection, licensing and veri fi cation of fi tness of vehicles.
- iii. Education  and Training: These  primarily  involve  spreading  road  safety  awareness  and imparting training to drivers. The initiatives undertaken in the fi eld of training are refresher training for heavy vehicle drivers and providing fi nancial assistance to states/UTs for setting up model driving schools to turn out well trained drivers.
- iv. Faster relief and  evacuation  of  road  accident  victims: In order to reduce the trauma  and  probability  of  death  and  disability  associated  with  the  road  accidents, National  Highway  Accident  Relief  Service  Scheme  has  been  initiated  which  provides for  supply  of  cranes  and  ambulances  to  states/UTs  and  NGOs  for  relief,  rescue  and

evacuation  of  accident  victims  to  the  closest  medical  centre  and  for  clearing  the accident site.

- v. Another  measure  is  medical  care  in  which fi nancial  assistance  upto ' 1.50  crores  was provided to the state government hospitals located on national highways for upgradation and strengthening of emergency facilities
- vi. Road Safety Audit: The  speci fi c  aim of the road safety audit is to minimise the risk and safety of accidents on the national highways and expressways.

## 4.20 Civil Aviation

4.20.1  The  Directorate  General  Civil  Aviation  (DGCA)  has  the  regulatory  responsibility  for aviation safety. Its mandate is to ensure the highest level of safety in the Indian Aviation System by  employing  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  standards  and  recommended practices. Mindful of India's State Safety Programme (SSP), DGCA is to maintain an integrated set of regulations and activities aimed at enhancing aviation safety.

4.20.2 DGCA implements proactive and as far as possible predictive strategies, for encouraging all stakeholders and service providers to understand the bene fi ts of a safety culture, which are based on an inclusive reporting culture. DGCA fosters and assists stakeholders in developing comprehensive Safety Management Systems (SMS) and develops preventive safety strategies for the aviation system in an environment of a 'just culture' . DGCA works with service providers in  a  cooperative  and  collaborative  manner  to  help  them  develop  and  establish  their  safety management systems.

4.20.3 The responsibility for coordination and search and rescue (SAR) with other agencies is, however vested with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) under the Airports Authority of India Act, 1944, as amended by AAI (Amendment) Rules, 2003.

4.20.4 The SSP is based on comprehensive analysis of the States Aviation System, safety policies, risk management, safety assurances and permission.

4.20.5 An appropriate legislative framework in safety management has been implemented in India in accordance with ICAO Standard and Recommended Practices (SARPs).  For carrying out ICAO functions, India has three layers of legislation -   the Aircraft Act 1934 which is the primary legislation, the secondary Aircraft Rules, 1937 and the tertiary Aircraft (Carriage of Dangerous Goods) Rules, 2003.

4.20.6 The DGCA has released a series of Safety Management System-Civil Aviation Regulation (SMS-CARs)  about  operational  regulations  and  implementation  policies  for  the  applicable service providers.

## 4.21 Conclusion

E ff ective planning and focus on prevention and mitigation would greatly help in ensuring that the hazards do not transform itself into disasters and the coping capacities of the vulnerable population is greatly increased. This would again need systematic planning and coordination to ensure that the Disaster Risk Reduction is constantly promoted and mainstreamed in the regular programmes of each department. Recently planning commission has constituted a committee for inclusion of DRR measures in the 12 th fi ve year plan.

## 5.1 Introduction

5.1.1  Facing  disaster  by  way  of  mitigation,  prevention,  preparedness,  response,  evacuation, relief  and  rehabilitation  has  been  part  of  the  administrative  ethos.  India  has  a  long  history of  rendering  relief  in  an  organized  fashion  in  times  of  drought  and  famine. The  states    have antiquated  relief code which deals with the general principles of administration of relief. It starts with the responsibility of the Government for combating distress, de fi ning scope of object of such measures etc. India, with a vast agrarian economy in the past had focused on distress relief mainly related to agricultural activities. Preparedness included collection of statistical data on the  rainfall,  weather  conditions,  crop  pattern  activities  relating  to  management  of  cattle  etc. The relief work focused on departmental work and village work for generation of employment during drought. With the changing pattern of disaster and with the introduction of technology, material and new fi nancial terms into disaster management, several modi fi cations have been incorporated in the administrative measures for relief work

5.1.2 The scope of disaster has since changed and so the response thereto. With the constitution of  successive  Finance  Commission under the provision of the Constitution, the measures for relief and the scope of disaster have enlarged. An attempt has been made in the succeeding paragraphs to capture the information relating to timely prediction/forecasting of di ff erent kind of  disasters  and  development  of  Standard  Operating  Procedures  (SOPs)  for  responding  such disasters.

## 5.2 Institutional Arrangements

5.2.1  Forecasting  about  climate  change  is  pre  requisite  for  taking  preparedness  measure  to respond to the disaster is the most important element of disaster management. The Ministry of  Environment  &amp;  Forest  (MoEF),  Ministry  of  Earth  Sciences  (MoES),  Ministry  of  Science  &amp; Technology (MST), Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), Ministry of Water Resources (MWR), Ministry of  Human  Resource  Development  (MHRD),  Ministry  of    Non-conventional  Energy  (MNES), Defence Research &amp; Development Organization (DRDO), Ministry of Defence (MoD), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) promote and undertake climate and climate change related research in the country.

Government of India has designated the  o ffi ces as given in the Box 5.1 as  the nodal agencies for early warning of di ff erent natural hazards:

| Box 5.1: Disaster wise nodal agencies for Forecast   | Box 5.1: Disaster wise nodal agencies for Forecast      |

| Avalanches                                           | Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment                  |
| Heat &amp; Cold Waves                                    | Indian Meteorological Department                        |

## 5.3 India Meteorological Department (IMD)

5.3.1 Modernized meteorological observations and research in India was initiated more than 200 year ago, since 1793, when the fi rst  Indian Meteorological observatory was set up at Madras (now  Chennai).  IMD  was  formally  established  in  1875  with  a  network  of  about  90  weather observatories for systematic observation and research.

5.3.2  India  Meteorological  Department's  tradition  of  monitoring  weather  and  climate  spans more than 135 years giving it a sound and useful dataset to fall back upon for environmental assessment. Ozone monitoring network was started as a globally pioneering e ff ort as early as in 1954 realizing that this trace gas plays a very important role in atmospheric chemical mechanisms. It also started radiation measurements about 50 year back and currently maintaining 45 stations in  the  country  for  providing  exclusive  countrywide  dataset  for  assessment  of  solar  energy resources.

5.3.3 A network of 10 Global Atmosphere Watch Stations (GAW, formerly Background Air Pollution Monitoring  Network  or  BAPMoN)  consisting  of  Allahabad,  Jodhpur,  Kodaikanal,  Minicoy, Mohanbari, Port Blair, Pune, Nagpur, Srinagar and Vishakhapatnam, is maintained by IMD as per WMO protocols and standards since 1974 to generate data and information on the exchange of trace materials between the atmosphere and the earth's surface, making atmospheric turbidity and air quality measurements to quantify trends and acid rain threats.

5.3.4 Atmospheric  monitoring: There  are  25  types  of  atmospheric  monitoring  networks that  are  operated  and  coordinated  by  the  IMD. This  includes  meteorological,  climatologically, environment, air pollution and other specialized observation of atmospheric trace constituents. It  maintains  559  surface  meteorological  observatories,  about  35  radio-stations  and  64  pilot balloon stations for monitoring the upper atmosphere. Specialized observations are made for agro  meteorological  purposes  at  219  stations  and  radiation  parameters  are  monitored  at  45 stations. There are about 70 observatories that monitor current weather conditions for aviation. The IMD collects meteorological data over oceans by an establishment of cooperation fl eet of Voluntary  Observing  Ships  (VOF)  comprising  merchant  ships  of  Indian  registry,  some  foreign merchant vessels and a few ships of the Indian Navy. These ships, while sailing on the high seas, function as fl oating observatories. Records of observations are passed on to the IMD for analysis and archival.

## 5.4.   Forecast of Rainfall

5.4.1 India receives 80 per cent of its annual rainfall during the southwest monsoon season of June to September. Rainfall over the country during this season shows a wide range of spatial variation due to orographic in fl uences and preferential occurrence of rain-bearing systems in certain regions. India has a very extensive rain gauge network and rainfall monitoring over the country.

5.4.2 The real-time monitoring and statistical analysis of district wise daily rainfall is one of the important functions of the IMD at New Delhi. Based on the real time daily rainfall data, weekly district  wise,  sub-division  wise  and  state  wise  rainfall  distribution  summaries  are  prepared regularly by the Rainfall Monitoring Unit. Maps showing weekly and cumulative rainfall fi gures in 36 meteorological subdivisions of the country are prepared. This information is very important to many user agencies, particularly for agricultural planning.

## 5.5. Forecasting System - Background

5.5.1 India Meteorological Department (IMD) follows a two-stage forecasting strategy for long range forecasting of the south-west monsoon season rainfall over the country as a whole. The Long Period Average (LPA) of the south-west monsoon season rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1951-2000 is 89cm. The fi rst long range forecast for the south-west monsoon season (June-September) rainfall is issued in April and the forecast update is issued in June.

From  2007  onwards,  IMD  has  been  using  the  following  statistical  models  for  preparing quantitative and probabilistic forecasts of the south-west monsoon rainfall (June - September) for the country as a whole:

- a. A 5- parameter statistical ensemble forecasting system requiring data up  to March, for the fi rst forecast in April.
- b. A 6-  parameter statistical  ensemble forecasting system requiring data up to May for the forecast update in June. Three of these 6-parameters are same as that used for April forecast.

For preparing the fi rst stage forecast for the 2011 South-west monsoon rainfall for the country as a whole presented here, the 5-parameter statistical ensemble forecasting system has been used.

- 5.5.2 Operational Statistical Forecast System :  In  the  IMD's  Ensemble  Statistical  Forecasting system  for  April  forecast,  the  following  5  predictors  are  used.  The  model  error  of  the  April forecasting systems is ±5%.

Table 5.1: Model error of the April forecasting systems

|   S.No | Predictor                                             | Period             |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
|      1 | North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature                | December + January |
|      2 | Equatorial South Indian Ocean Sea Surface Temperature | February + March   |
|      3 | East Asia Mean Sea Level Pressure                     | February + March   |
|      4 | NW Europe Land Surface Air Temperature                | January            |
|      5 | Equatorial Paci fi c Warm Water Volume                | February + March   |

The 5-parameter ensemble statistical forecasting system was also used to prepare probability forecasts for fi ve pre-de fi ned rainfall categories. These are de fi cient (less than 90% of LPA), below normal (90-96% of LPA), normal (96-104% of LPA), above normal (104-110% of LPA) and excess (above 110% of LPA). The forecasted probabilities in percentage based on this system for the above 5 categories are 6%, 30%, 53%, 10% and 1% respectively.

- 5.5.3 Experimental  Forecasts: IMD  has  an  experimental  dynamical  forecast  system.  The experimental  ensemble  dynamical  forecast  for  the  2011  south-west  monsoon  rainfall  was computed  as  the  ensemble  average  of  10  member  forecasts  with  forecasted  sea  surface temperatures (SST) as boundary SST forcing.

In addition, IMD takes into account the experimental forecasts prepared by the national institutes like Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Space Applications  Centre,  Ahmedabad,  National  Aerospace  Laboratories,  Bangalore,  Centre  for Mathematical  Modelling  and  Computer  Simulation,  Bangalore,  National  Centre  for  Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida and Center for Development of Advanced Computing, Pune.

## Disaster Management in India

Operational/experimental forecasts prepared by international institutes like the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, USA, International Research Institute for Climate and Society, USA, Meteorological O ffi ce, UK, the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts, UK , the Experimental  Climate  Prediction  Center,  USA,  and  World  Meteorological  Organization's  Lead Centre for Long Range Forecasting - Multi-Model Ensemble were also taken into account.

The experimental forecasts from majority of the statistical and dynamical models suggest below normal to normal monsoon season rainfall over the country as a whole.

5.5.4 Sea Surface Temperature Conditions over the equatorial Paci fi c &amp; Indian Oceans: The El Niño conditions that were originated since June, 2009 peaked in December 2009 and then started to weaken to reach ENSO-neutral conditions in May, 2010. This continued till mid June when weak La Nina conditions emerged. The La Niña conditions strengthened subsequently and become moderate to strong during mid-August 2010 to early February 2011. The La Nina conditions since have weakened to weak to moderate strength as of mid-March 2011. The latest forecasts from a majority of the dynamical and statistical models indicate strong probability for the present La Niña conditions to continue till June. Subsequently the La Nina conditions are expected to weaken further to reach ENSO- neutral conditions. However, it may be mentioned that the climate forecasts prepared at this time of the year has large uncertainty.

It is important to note that in addition to ENSO events, other factors such as the Indian Ocean Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have also signi fi cant in fl uence on Indian monsoon. Recent forecasts from some coupled models suggest possibility of the development of a weak negative Indian Ocean Dipole event during the second half of the year, which may not have much impact on the Indian monsoon.

As the extreme sea surface temperature conditions over Paci fi c and Indian Oceans particularly ENSO conditions over Paci fi c  (El  Nino  or  La  Nina)  are  known to have strong in fl uence on the Indian summer monsoon, IMD is carefully monitoring the sea surface conditions over Paci fi c and Indian oceans.

5.5.5 Forecast for the 2011 South-west monsoon rainfall :  IMD's long range forecast for the 2011 south-west monsoon season (June to September) is that the rainfall for the country as a whole is most likely to be Normal (96-104% of Long Period Average (LPA)). There is very low probability for season rainfall to be de fi cient (below 90% of LPA) or excess (above 110% of LPA).

Quantitatively, monsoon season rainfall is likely to be 98% of the LPA with a model error of ± 5%. The LPA of the season rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1951-2000 is 89 cm.

IMD will update the above forecast in June 2011 as a part of the second stage forecast. Along with the update forecast, separate forecasts for the monthly (July and August) rainfall over the country as a whole and seasonal (June-September) rainfall over the four geographical regions of India will also be issued. Forecast for the rainfall over the country as a whole during the second of the season (August + September) will be issued in July and that for September will be issued in August.

## 5.6   Forecasting and Warning of Cyclones

5.6.1 IMD is the nodal agency in the country to monitor and predict the cyclonic disturbances and  issue  the  warning  and  advisory  bulletins.  IMD,  New  Delhi  also  acts  as  a  Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for providing tropical cyclone advisories to the World

Meteorological Organization (WMO)/ Economic and Social Cooperation for Asia and the Paci fi c (ESCAP)  Panel  members  countries  viz  Bangladesh,  Myanmar,  Thailand,  Sri  Lanka,  Maldives, Pakistan and Oman. IMD, New Delhi also works as a Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre (TCAC) for international civil aviation as per the requirement of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)

5.6.2 The cyclone warning are issued to State Government o ffi cials in four stages: i.e.

- (i) pre-cyclone watch issued 72 hours in advance,
- (ii) cyclone alert issued at least 48 hours in advance ,
- (iii) cyclone warning issued at least 24 hours in advance, and
- (iv) as post landfall outlook issued at least 12 hours in advance of expected time of landfall.

IMD  has  prepared  roadmap  for  cyclonegenesis  and  further  intensi fi cation,  monitoring  and prediction.

## 5.7. Flood Forecasting - Central Water Commission 27

- 5.7.1 The fl ood forecasting and warning system is used for alerting the likely damage centre well in advance of the actual arrival of fl oods, to enable the people to move and also to remove the moveable property to safer places or to raised platforms specially constructed for the purpose.
- 5.7.2  A  beginning in  scienti fi c fl ood forecasting was made in November, 1958 by CWC (then known as Central Water &amp; Power Commission) when a Flood Forecasting Centre was set up at its  Headquarters, at Delhi for giving timely Forecasts and Warnings of the incoming fl oods to the villages located in the river areas around the National Capital, Delhi. The network has been expanding and by now the Flood Forecasting Network of the CWC covers the entire major fl ood prone inter State basins in the country.

5.7.3 The fl ood forecasting involves the following four main activities:

- (i) observation and collection of hydrological and hydro meteorological data,
- (ii) transmission of Data to forecasting centres,
- (iii) analysis of data and formulation of forecast, and
- (iv) Dissemination of forecast.
- 5.7.4 On an average 6000 forecasts at various places in the country are issued during the monsoon seasons every year. The analysis of the forecasts issued during the last 25 years (1978 to 2002) indicates that accuracy of forecasts has consistently increased from around 81% to 98%. Forecast is considered accurate if forecast water level is within + 15 cm of actual water level of the in fl ow forecast (i.e. discharge) and is within + 20% of actual discharge.

5.7.5 In monitoring the fl oods, severity of fl oods are placed in the following four categories by the CWC

- (i) Low Flood  stage  -  It  is  that fl ood  situation  when  the  water  level  of  the  river  is fl owing between warning level and danger level of the forecasting stations.
- (ii) Medium  ood stage - The river is called in medium fl fl oods when its water level is at or above the danger level of the forecasting station but below 0.50 of its highest fl ood level (HFL)

## Disaster Management in India

- (iii) High fl ood state - When the water level of the river is below the HFL but within 0.50 m of the HFL of the forecasting stations.
- (iv) Unprecedented fl ood stage - The river is called in unprecedented fl oods when it attains water level equal to or above its previous HFL at any forecasting stations.

5.7.6 A computerized monitoring system has been developed under which daily water levels as observed at 0800 hours and forecasts issued by fi eld units are transmitted to CWC headquarters in  New  Delhi.  Based  on  the  compilation  of  all  such  data  received  from fi eld  divisions,  daily water level and fl ood forecast bulletins in two parts for stage and for in fl ow forecasting stations respectively.

## 5.8  Tsunami  warning  -  Indian  National  Centre  for  Oceanic  Information  System (INCOIS) 28

5.8.1 Post tsunami dated 26 th December, 2004, Ministry of Earth Sciences has established the Indian  National  Tsunami  Warning  System  at  Indian  National  Centre  for  Ocean  Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad. The Tsunami Early Warning System (TEWS) was made operational on 15 th Oct 2007. This agency has developed a protocol for issue for Tsunami Watch, Alert and Warnings. The  Centre  gives  information  to  all  responders  about  the  origin,  time,  location  of the epicenter, magnitude and depth of an earthquake inside the ocean and accordingly issues bulletins.

5.8.2  The  system  is  capable  of  detecting  all  earthquake  events  of  more  than  6  Magnitude occurring  in  the  Indian  Ocean  in  less  than  20  minutes  of  occurrence  and fi rst  report  on  the occurrence of an earthquake in India and the Indian Ocean region to sent to MHA within 2530  minutes  indicating  the  location  and  magnitude  of  the  earthquake.  Further,  if  any  rise  in water level is reported by NIOT, TEWC would issue a Tsunami warning within 60 minutes of the occurrence of the earthquake. The information so generated would be disseminated through various communication channels to the concerned user agencies in a fully automated mode.

## 5.9 Warning about Landslide hazard - Geological Survey of India (GSI)

5.9.1 Geological Survey of India (GSI), established in 1851 is a government organization under the Union Ministry of Mines with the Headquarter at New Delhi for conducting geological surveys and studies. It is one of the oldest of such organizations in the world.

5.9.2 The GSI was designated as nodal agency for coordinating geological studies, landslides hazard  zonation,  monitoring  landslides,  avalanches,  studying  the  factors  responsible  and suggesting precautionary and preventive measure on 29 th  January, 2004. The input from GSI as  nodal agency help the Ministries and Departments concerned in the Central Government as well as the State Government for taking appropriate preventive and mitigation measures for reducing landslide hazard and responding in the mountainous areas and hill in the Himalayan and sub Himalayan regions. GSI is the nodal agency responsible for early warning relating to the landslides in the country.

- 5.9.3 Study of Land Contour by GSI: Geological Survey of India (GSI) studies the shape and material of the land getting inundated and generates data on area, shape, slope, in fi ltration and permeability of soil of the basin, drainage pattern, landform and longitudinal and cross pro fi les of  the  channels.  On  the  basis  of  these  studies,  GSI  produces fl ood  hazard  maps  indicating

Prohibitive, Restricted, Cautionary and Flood Free Zones.  Signi fi cant fl ood related studies and recommendations made by GSI are as follows:

- · Brahmaputra  Valley  -  a  comprehensive  geo-environmental  data  base  for  environmental management and fl ood control generated,
- · Lower Banas sub-basin - selective irrigation to prevent rise of groundwater table recommended,
- · Kandi basin in West Bengal-  GSI recommended construction of small weirs to reduce impact of fl ood,
- · Mokameh Tal area in the Ganga Flood plain - rejuvenation of existing drainage channels to reduce fl ood problem recommended,
- · Lower Damodar Basin- diversion along artificial canals and re-excavation of old river channel recommended,
- · Landslide zonation map for Himalayan region,
- · The contribution of snow melting to annual flood.

GSI's fl ood related studies are used by Central Water Commission, Water Resource Development Project Authorities, Urban and Rural Planning Authorities, Ministry of Environment and Forest, Ministry of Agriculture, etc.

## 5.12 Radiological and Nuclear Emergencies

5.12.1  Department  of  Atomic  Energy  (DAE)  is  the  nodal  agency  for  providing  the  necessary technical inputs to the National or local authorities for responding to any nuclear or radiological emergency.    The  Ministry  of  Home  A ff airs  (MHA)  is  the  nodal  ministry  to  coordinate  with the  various  response  agencies  in  the  event  of  any  nuclear  or  radiological  disaster  in  the public  domain.  A  Crisis  Management  Group  (CMG)  has  been  functioning  since  1987  at  DAE for  this  purpose.  This  Group  is  chaired  by  the  Additional  Secretary,  DAE,  and  has  on  board expert members from di ff erent units of DAE and Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB). Each member has an alternate member and CMG is backed by resource agencies of various units of DAE.

5.12.2  Based  on  the  radiological  conditions  and  their  consequences,  emergencies  at  nuclear facilities are categorized as emergency standby, personnel emergency, plant emergency, on-site emergency and o ff -site emergency. As a basic regulatory requirement, emergency preparedness exists at all nuclear and radiation facilities to respond to any on-site or o ff -site  emergency in their areas. But to handle radiological emergencies arising from a transport accident or from the movement or handling of 'orphan source' (radioactive sources that have lost regulatory control is called 'orphan sources') or due to malevolent acts like explosion of an RDD, Radiation Exposure Device (RED) or IND any time or anywhere in the country, a network of 18 units of Emergency Response Centers (ERCs) has been established by Bhabha Atomic Research Center, DAE. These ERCs are equipped with radiation monitoring instruments, protective gear and other supporting infrastructure.

## 5.13 Installation of Radiological Detection Equipment

5.13.1 As a part of preparedness measure Radioactive Detection Equipments (RDE's) are being installed at entry and exit points in the country. On the initiatives of MHA and in consultation with the various Stakeholders, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and Electric Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) a technical survey of the entry and exit points in a phased manner was undertake for installation of the RDE's. The survey for installation of RDEs at 29 entry/exit points has been identi fi ed by BARC (12 seaports, 14 airports and 3 international borders).

## 5.14 Director General of Mines Safety

5.14.1 Mining activity accounts for about 1% of the world employment but contributes to about 7% fatalities at the work place. In 1901 the then British Government in India established Bureau of Mines (now Directorate General of Mines Safety) with its headquarter at Calcutta with the object to enforce provisions of Mines Act.  Till 1985, the Director General of Mines Safety was also entrusted with the job of covering the rescue and recovery operations at mines.  The Rescue Station was headed by an Ex-o ffi cio Director of DGMS and the rescue was funded by a cess collected

## Disaster Management in India

from the coal companies.   Rescue Rules under Mines Act, 1952 were framed in 1985 according to which standards/quantity/type of equipment/place of rescue station etc. were also governed.

5.14.2 Coal companies have provided and maintained rescue station in the heart of coal mining areas namely at Sitarampur (WB), Dhanbad (Jharkhand), Manindragarh (Chhatisgarh), Indora (Nagpur),  Ramgarh  (Jharkhand),  Karimnagar  (AP)  etc.  In  case  of  Metalliferous  sector,  rescue room at the mine level/rescue station at the company level have been provided and maintained in the centrally located of mining areas by various companies engaged in metal mining, namely HZL at Udaipur (Rajasthan); UCIL at Jadugoda (Jharkahnd); MOIL at Balaghat (Nagpur); HGML at Hutti ( Karnataka); HCL at Khetri,( Rajasthan) etc.

## 5.15  Epidemic

5.15.1 Three core capacities are essentially required to deal with epidemics. These are

- (i) Establishment/strengthening of a laboratory based disease surveillance system to collect baseline  data  on  infectious  diseases,  monitor  disease  trends  and  to  detect  epidemics  in early rising phase,
- (ii) Development  of  epidemiological,  clinical,  entomological  and  laboratory  capacities  to investigate the epidemics to characterize the cases in terms of time, person and place and to understand the transmission dynamics, and
- (iii) Development  of  response  capacities  to  prevent/control  the  epidemics  to  reduce  the morbidity and mortality to the minimum.

5.15.2 The outbreaks/epidemics are usually investigated by the district or state Rapid Response Teams.  Several  central/regional  institutes  like  National  Centre  for  Disease  Control  (formerly National Institute of Communicable Diseases), Delhi; National Institute of Virology, Pune; National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata; Vector Control Research Centre, Puducherry and other ICMR institutes provide epidemiological, laboratory and entomological support to the  states  for  investigation  and  control  when  the  outbreaks/epidemics  are  widespread  and states request for assistance. Also there is increasing collaboration with Department of Animal Husbandry in managing emerging zoonotic diseases such as avian in fl uenza and Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever.

## 5.16 Preparedness

- 5.16.1 Annual Conference of Relief Commissioners and Secretaries of States and  UTs :  An  annual  Conference  of  Relief  Commissioners,  Secretaries,  to  the  Department  of Disaster Management of States and UTs is organized before the onset of south west monsoon to  review  the  status  of  preparedness  for  ensuing  Monsoon  and  to  discuss  other  disaster management  related  issues. The  representatives  of  various  Central  Ministries,  Organizations rendering Emergency Support Functions besides representatives of Central Para-Military Forces also participate.

- · Medicines
- · Drinking water
- · Shelter/Camps

## 5.17 Trigger Mechanism

This mechanism has been developed to activate the disaster response system automatically after receiving warning signals of a disaster happening or likely to happen or on receipt of information about the incident. The responders are required to undertake activities as per the SOPs issued in respect of such disasters. There may be scenario where early warning signals could be available and there may happen a disaster without any early warning.

## 5.18 Crisis Management Plan (CMP) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

5.18.1 In accordance with National Crisis Management Plan 2003 of the Cabinet Secretariat, MHA has formulated its CMP 2004 and circulated it to all States and UTs. The CMP of MHA comprises of two parts; Part-I deals with aspects, which are common to all contingencies situations and Part-II about the individual Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for dealing with speci fi c crisis situation. SOPs are preparedness plan which emerges and activates the procedure for response on receipt of calamity or receipt of fi gure of impending disaster. It identi fi es the fi nancial and administration powers to the people made responsible for the procedure.

5.18.2 The CMP of MHA is reviewed periodically. It was last reviewed in 2009 and was circulated to all Ministries and Departments of Central Government as well as States and UTs. An SOP for management of Natural Disasters formulated by this Ministry has also been circulated vide this Ministry's letter No.32-35/2003-NDM-I dated 21-04-2009.

5.18.3 The State Governments have been advised to formulate the similar kind of the CMP and SOPs. MHA has conducted number of training workshops for the States and UTs for assisting them in formulation of the SOPs.

## 5.19 Role and Responsibility of Central and State Governments

5.19.1 Ministry of Home A ff airs is the nodal Ministry for management of natural disasters (other than drought, hailstorm and pest attack, which are handled by Ministry of Agriculture) on behalf of the Government of India. Disaster Management Division (DM Division) performs the function in the Ministry of Home A ff airs.

5.19.2  The  Central  and  State  Governments  are  jointly  responsible  for  undertaking  relief, rehabilitation,  preparedness,  mitigation  and  response  measures.  The  basic  responsibility  for undertaking these measures in the event of a disaster rests with the concerned State Government. The Central Government supplements the e ff orts of the State Governments by providing logistic and fi nancial support in case of natural calamities of severe nature. The logistic support includes

- · Pre- Contract
- · Evacuation Plan
- · Activating Control Rooms
- · Search &amp; Rescue Team
- · Communication
- · Identification of Nodal Officer
- · Status of SDRF
- · Preparedness Drill

## It is constituted to

- · Oversee all aspects relating to management of natural calamities including assessment of the situation and identi fi cation of measures considered necessary to reduce its impact,
- · Examine and implement programmes for reducing the adverse impact of natural calamities,
- · Monitor and suggest long term measures for prevention of such calamities in the future; and,
- · Formulate  and  recommend  programmes  for  public  awareness  for  building  up  society's resilience to natural calamities.

The Committee is to be serviced by Ministry of Home A ff airs in all cases except in cases relating to Drought Management and Epidemics when it is serviced, as the case may be, by the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation and Department of Health and Family Welfare.

## 5.22  National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC)

At the Centre, under the Chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary the NCMC has been constituted in the Cabinet Secretariat.  The other members of this Committee include the Secretary to the Prime Minister, Secretaries of the Ministries of Home A ff airs, Defence, Information &amp; Broadcasting, RAW,  NDMA,  Deputy  NSA  and    Director  of  Intelligence  Bureau.  Secretary  (Security)  Cabinet Secretariat is the convener of the NCMC. The NCMC gives direction to the Crisis Management Group as deemed necessary.

## 5.23 Crisis Management Group (CMG)/National Executive Committee

This is a group under the Chairmanship of the Home Secretary comprising the senior o ffi cers from  the  various  ministries  and  other  concerned  departments.    CMG's  function  is  to  review contingency  plans  every  year  formulated  by  the  Central  Ministries/  Departments  and  the measures required for dealing with a natural disaster; co-ordinate the activities of the Central Ministries and the State Governments in relation to disaster preparedness and relief and to obtain

information from the nodal o ffi cers on measures relating to the above.  The Joint Secretary (DM) is the Convener of CMG for natural disasters.

## 5.24 Role of the State Government

5.24.1 In the context of federal set-up of India, the responsibility to formulate the Governments response to a natural calamity is essentially that of the concerned State Government. However, the Central Government, with its resources, physical and fi nancial does provide the needed help and assistance to buttress relief e ff orts in the wake of major natural disasters.  The dimensions of  the  response  at  the  level  of  National  Government  are  determined  in  accordance  with  the existing policy of fi nancing the relief expenditure and keeping in view the factors like.

- (i) gravity of a natural calamity,
- (ii) scale of the relief operation necessary, and
- (iii) Requirements of Central assistance for augmenting the fi nancial resources at the disposal of the State Government.

5.24.2  Most  of  the  States  have  Relief  Commissioners  under  the  Department  of  Disaster Management, who are in charge of the relief measures in the wake of natural disasters.  In the absence of the Relief Commissioner, the Chief Secretary or an O ffi cer nominated by him is in overall charge of the Relief operations in the concerned State.

5.24.3 At the state level, the State Relief Commissioner supervises and controls relief operations through Collectors or Deputy Commissioners, who are the main functionaries to coordinate the relief  operation at district level.  The State Governments are autonomous in organizing relief operations  in  the  event  of  natural  disasters  and  in  developing  the  long-term  rehabilitation measures.  The State Government's e ff orts are supplemented by central Government based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission.

## 5.25 State Crisis Management Group (SCMG)

5.25.1  There  is  a  State  Crisis  Management  Group  (SCMG)  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Chief Secretary and Relief Commissioner.  This Group comprises senior o ffi cers from the Departments of  Revenue/relief,  Home, Civil  Supplies,  Power,  Irrigation, Water  Supply,  Panchayat  (local  selfgovernment), Agriculture, Forests, rural Development, and health, Planning, Public Works and Finance.

5.25.2 The SCMG is required to take into consideration the guidance received, from time to time, from Government of India and formulate action plans for dealing with di ff erent natural disasters. It is also the duty of the Relief Commissioner of the State to establish a Emergency Operation Center (Control Room) at State headquarters as soon as a disaster situation develops.  Besides having all updated information on forecasting and warning of disaster, the EOC would also be the contact point for the various concerned agencies.

## 5.26   Role of District Administration

5.26.1 The district Administration is the focal point for fi eld level organizations. It is responsible for implementation of all government contingency plans.  Considerable powers have therefore been wrested upon the District Collector to carry out operations in the shortest possible time.

5.26.2 The District Administration in the country is required to prepare an advance Contingency Plan depending on the type of disaster likely to a ff ect the district.  Contingency Plans are to follow a framework as laid down nationally which comprises type of preparedness, the relief material required to be mobilized and the concerned departments that need to work together and provide an e ffi cient feedback and monitoring system.

5.26.3 The District Magistrate exercises coordinating and supervisory powers over functionaries of all the Departments at the district level in the event of emergencies.  During actual operations for disaster mitigation or relief, the powers of the Collector are considerably enhanced, generally, by standing instructions or orders on the subject, or by speci fi c Governments orders, if so required. Sometimes, the administrative culture of the State concerned permits, although informally, the collector to exercise higher powers in emergency situations and the decisions are later rati fi ed by the competent authority.

5.26.4 District Relief Committee: The district level Relief Committee consisting of o ffi cial and non-o ffi cial members including the local Legislators and the Members of Parliament reviews the relief measures.

## 5.27 Role of Sub-district Administration

A District is sub-divided into sub-divisions and Tehsils or Talukas.  The head of a sub-division is  called the Sub-Divisional O ffi cer (SDO) while the head of a Tehsil is generally known as the Tehsildar (Talukdar or Mamlatdar in some States).  Contact with the individual villages is through the village O ffi cer or Patwari who has one or more villages in his charge.  When a disaster is apprehended,  the  entire  machinery  of  the  District,  including  o ffi cers  of  technical  and  other Departments, swings into action and maintains almost continuous contact with each village in the disaster threatened area.  In the case of extensive disasters like drought, contact is maintained over a short cycle of a few days.  The entire hierarchy right from the Central Government (the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation in the Ministry of Agriculture and irrigation) to the District level is connected by means of a telecommunication system.

## Control Rooms

## 5.28 National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC)

5.28.1  The  National  Emergency  Operation  Centre  (NEOC)  in  the  Ministry  of  Home  A ff airs functions 24X7 to monitor the disaster or disaster like situation. Based on the feedback received from  National  Forecasting  Agencies  viz  Indian  Meteorological  Department,  Central  Water Commission, Snow &amp; Avalanche Study Establishment etc. advisories to the concerned States/UTs are issued from time to time for keeping watch on the developing situation and take necessary measures such as evacuation of the vulnerable persons, operation of relief camps, pre positioning of essential commodities etc.

5.28.2 During the south west monsoon, daily situation reports (sitreps) are prepared based on the feedback received from the a ff ected States and concerned Central Ministries and organizations, and are sent to all concerned.  During the calamities of severe nature, special situation reports are  also  prepared  and  issued  to  all  concerned.  NEOC  also  issue  SMS  alerts  to  the  concerned

## 5.29 State Control Room

There is a State Level Control Room set up whenever a disaster situation develops.  The Control Room is responsible for:

- (i) Transmitting information about the development of a crisis as a result of natural disaster on continued basis to the Central Relief Commissioner.
- (ii) Receiving  instructions  and  communicating  them  to  appropriate  agencies  for  immediate action.
- (iii) Collection and submission of information relating to implementation of relief measures to the Central Relief Commissioner; and
- (iv) Keeping the State level authorities apprised of the developments on a continuing basis.

## 5.30 District Control Room

Likewise in the wake of natural disasters, a Control Room is set up in the district for day-today monitoring of the rescue and relief operations on a continuing basis, operationalising the contingency plan and keep close liaison with the State Headquarters, NGOs and other agencies dealing with disaster management and relief.

## 5.31 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)

5.31.1 Task and role of NDRF: The main task of NDRF is to provide specialist response in case of disasters which broadly covers:

- · NBC disasters ( Decontamination of the area and personnel)

5.31.2 Specialized equipment for NDRF  Battalions: In  NDRF  has  been equipped  with  latest  and  state  of  the art equipments required for the rescue and relief works. 310 di ff erent types of equipments  have  been  authorized  to NDRF which broadly consist of Medical First Responder (MFR) Equipments, Collapsed  Structure  Search  &amp;  Rescue (CSSR), water rescue, CBRN equipments, specialist vehicle etc. The details of such equipment  may  be  visited  at www. ndmindia.nic.in

## Box 5.4: Rescue and relief measures leading to further disasters - Tamil Nadu experience

Inadequate  planning  and  preparation  in  rescue  and relief may lead to further disasters. - '42 persons die in a stampede at Chennai fl ood relief camp -  They came in droves seeking relief from their tragedy, instead they fell victim to another tragedy as a stampede on Sunday (18 th December 2005) at a relief camp for fl ood victims in Chennai which  left 42 people dead and 40 injured. Hundreds of people ran  for  cover  following  a  sudden downpour and fell on each other, crushing women and children  in  their  wake.  The  tragedy  occurred  at  4.30 a.m. as a crowd of around 4,500 - largely poor people -  gathered in front of the locked gate of Arignar Anna Corporation Higher Secondary School at K.K. Nagar in west  Chennai  to  receive  food  and  other  relief  goods. The K.K. Nagar relief camp in the school was one of 141 such  camps  in  and  around  Chennai  distributing  relief to victims of fl oods caused by unprecedented rains in di ff erent parts of the state since October' .

## 5. 32 State Disaster Response Force (SDRF)

The  States/UTs    have  also  been  advised  to  set  up  their  own  Specialist  Response  force  for responding to disasters  on the lines of National Disaster Response Force vide Ministry of Home A airs letter dt 26 ff th July 2007 and vide this Ministry's letter dated 08 March 2011. The Central Government is providing assistance for training of trainers. The State Governments have been also advised to utilize 10% of their State Disaster Response Fund and Capacity Building Grant for the procurement of search and rescue equipment and for training purposes of the Response Force.

## 5.33 Policy for Acceptance of External Assistance

The  present  policy  of  Government  of  India  is  to  not  issue  a  formal  appeal  on  behalf  of  the Government, either directly or through any other agency, to attract relief. However, relief donated on a voluntary basis are accepted and acknowledged as a sign of international solidarity.  There is no objection to NGO's issuing appeals for donations provided it is clear that the appeals are not at the instance of the Government of India. In the case of UN organisations and agencies (like OCHA) such appeals would imply endorsement by member countries and they are advised against appeals for international assistance.

## 5.34 Drought Relief Measures

5.34.1  Management  of  drought  has  now  been  outlined  in  much  elaborated  manner  in  the drought manual issued by ministry of Agriculture and cooperation.

5.34.2 Following drought declaration, planning and implementation of drought relief and response measures is initiated. It is necessary that these measures are undertaken promptly so that it would mitigate  the  hardship  faced  by  the  people.  Though  these  measures  are  sector  speci fi c,  they require immense inter department coordination. Implementing these measures would require a continuous fl ow of information from the village level to the highest level of decision making in the State and a responsive administrative structure. It would also require careful fi nancial planning so that the implementation of these measures could be undertaken on a sustained basis.

5.34.3 Contingency crop planning: Ministry of Agriculture, Government of       India, Indian Council  of  Agricultural  Research  (ICAR),  State  Government  agriculture  departments  and agricultural universities need to prepare the contingency crop plan and disseminate it among farmers  with  the  help  to  support  agencies,  mentioned  below. The  alternative  crop  planning involves choosing suitable crops and / or crop varieties, alternative crop strategies, mid season's corrections and crop life saving measures.

5.34.4 Relief  employment: The  most  important  relief  component  is  the      generation  of employment provision during the drought period.  As soon as drought is declared, it is therefore, necessary for the State Governments to immediately start relief employment programmes and provide work to those who need employment within a radius of fi ve kilometers.

5.34.5 Most State Governments have their own food for work programme. The Government of India  has  started  the  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee  Scheme  (NREGS),  providing  100 days of employment to one person per family on demand. The scheme has been extended to the entire country. A large number of public works and watershed programmes could be supported through the NREGS. These programmes together can create substantial employment to tide over the hardship and deprivation caused by drought.

- 5.34.6 Water resource management: Water resource management in the     drought a ff ected areas is one of the most critical tasks of relief operations. It requires diverse measures such as augmentation of water supply, rationing of water use, and e ffi cient utilization and management of water resources, in both urban and rural areas. Shortage of water is one of the earliest indicators of drought, a ff ecting the entire society, rural and urban. Assessing the demand for water and its total availability in a speci fi c region, therefore, is extremely important for meeting the needs of di ff erent user groups.
- 5.34.7 Food  security Food  security  is  one  of  the  most  important  objectives  of  drought management. It is provided through food for work programmes, which are started by the State Governments to provide relief employment. Wages on these relief employment works are paid in the form of foodgrains, on a full or partial basis.

5.34.8 The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), extended to all the districts across the country, guarantees employment opportunities in the rural areas by providing work that taps labour intensive community assets. It assures manual work to one person per family for a maximum of 100 days in a year.

## 5.34.9 Relief through tax waivers and

concessions : The primary objective of the tax waivers and concessions would be  to  help  people  meet  their  basic entitlements.  The  State  Government can take a conscious decision to provide a number of tax waivers and concessions when a drought is declared.  These  tax waivers  and concessions  should  be  decided  on the basis of the entitlement needs of certain  segments  of  the  population and  the fi scal  implications  of  such  a relief  to  the  State  Government.  Each State Government may decide on tax waivers and concessions to the people a ff ected  by  drought,  depending  on fi scal situation of the State and severity of the drought.

5.34.10 Cattle camps and fodder supply: State  Governments  need  to support their farmers in protecting their cattle population during a drought situation by providing necessary assistance  for  fodder,  feed,  and  cattle

health.      During  a  drought  situation,  every  measure  needs  to  be  taken  to  save  useful  cattle. When cattle wealth is seriously depleted the recovery is very slow. While sheep and goats have a potential for rapid growth, perhaps 25% a year or more, the growth of cow, bu ff aloes and camels is much slower, rarely more than 1-2% a year in a sustained manner. It is necessary to provide support to farmers for fodder so that they do not engage in distress selling of their cattle.

5.34.11 Health  and  hygiene: In  a  drought  situation,  health  issues  are  largely  related  to contamination of water and spread of infection among the workers participating in public works programmes. People have less immunity in drought situations due to poor levels of nutrition. Necessary precautions need to be taken to prevent the spread of any water borne epidemic and other infectious diseases.

5.34.12 Institutional response: Drought management requires a strong institutional structure to monitor and provide a timely response to drought. While it is primarily the responsibility of the State Government to manage drought, the Central Government also plays an important role in monitoring drought and providing fi nancial assistance to the States. The district administration headed by the Collector plays the most critical role in responding to drought on the ground. At  the  Central  level,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  is  the  department  responsible  for  drought monitoring and management.

5.34.13 Role  of  Panchayati  Raj  institutions: It  is  necessary  to  involve  the  Panchayati  Raj Institutions (PRIs) - Zila Parishads, Panchayat Samitis and village Panchayats in the implementation of drought management programmes.

5.34.14 Financing relief expenditure: In post independent India, fi nancing relief expenditure has largely been arranged through the Finance Commission appointed under Article 280 of the Constitution. In the earlier phases the role of the Commission was restricted to suggesting the pattern of fi nancial assistance by the centre. Subsequently the recommendations were enlarged to cover the 'scheme of fi nancing relief expenditure' .

5.34.15 Information management  and  media  coordination : The Central and State Governments should provide information on all aspects of drought to the people and media. It is necessary to inform the people about the severity and impact of drought and the measures being taken to alleviate the drought situation.

## 5.35 Conclusion

The preparedness and response phase in the Disaster management cycle are critical in reducing the impact of disasters. The involvement of multi-various stakeholders, therefore, need to ensure e ffi cient  inter-departmental  coordination  and  need  to  constantly  review  and  improve  the systems in place. It has  to be kept in mind to ensure that the focus on these two areas help in bringing a tangible improvement in handling the disasters.

## 6.1 Background

6.1.1 The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) de fi nes recovery as the 'decisions and  actions  taken  after  a  disaster  with  a  view  to  restore  or  improve  the  pre-disaster  living conditions of the stricken community, while encouraging and facilitating necessary adjustments to reduce disaster risk' .

6.1.2  While  emergency  response  is  vital  as  it  is  aimed  at  saving  human  lives  and  providing relief, the ultimate objective of any crisis management is restoration of devastated livelihoods. Recovery e ff orts following rescue and relief in any disaster can be classi fi ed into short term and long term. The short term activities for recovery are debris clearance, providing semi-permanent shelter  and  ensuring  sanitation  and  restoring  lifelines,  while  the  long  term  activities  involve building a safer and more sustainable livelihood.

## 6.2 Nature of Recovery

6.2.1 The damage caused by fl oods, earthquakes and cyclones is on a much larger scale than other disasters and recovery after these disasters poses a challenge. In disasters like drought, the relief phase is prolonged and since there is no damage to the infrastructure and property, the rehabilitation is con fi ned to restoration of livelihoods which can get subsumed in normal development programmes.

6.2.2  Recovery in case of epidemics is more in the form of sanitising the locality against any future recurrence and may also involve counseling of the victims. Industrial disasters being quite varied  in  nature,  the  rehabilitation  in  major  ones  like  the 'Bhopal  Gas Tragedy'  could  involve rehabilitation e ff orts spanning over a generation of victims apart from restoring livelihoods and providing social and psychological assistance.

6.2.3 Rehabilitation following disasters such as landslides and avalanches is localised and is of a similar nature as in earthquakes but on a smaller scale. Finding safer sites near such locations often poses challenges and resistance.

## 6.3 Guiding Principles for Post-Recovery

Box 6.1 illustrates the principles applied generally based on international practices.

## Box 6.1: Guiding Principles for Post- Recovery

- · Mainstreaming disaster risk reduction in recovery and development process,
- · Improving coordination,
- · Promoting participatory approaches and decentralising planning and programming for recovery,
- · Enhancing safety standards and integrating risk reduction in reconstruction and development,
- · Improving the living conditions of the a ff ected communities and sectors,
- · Building  local  and  national  capacities  for  increased  resilience,  risk  management  and  sustainable development,
- · Taking advantage of ongoing initiatives,
- · Gender sensibility,
- · Demonstrative e ff ects,
- · Monitoring, evaluation and learning.

## Disaster Management in India

## 6.4 Assessment

The fi rst step after stabilizing the situation by providing su ffi cient relief is to assess the damage. A meticulously executed assessment exercise would provide an ideal base for the rehabilitation e ff orts. This exercise is best carried out through multi-disciplinary teams which go into all aspects of damage (social, economical, psychological) in participation with the local community. Based on the assessment of the damage and the needs, a recovery strategy has to be formulated. The strategy  should  include  all  interventions  -  economic,  social,  political  and  psychological.  The resources  should  be  identi fi ed  and  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  all  concerned  should  be de ned. fi

## 6.5 Co-ordination

6.5.1 Following  any  major  disaster,  a  number  of  players  arrive  on  the  scene  and  as  already stated, ensuring proper coordination amongst them thus becomes very important. Recovery activities are taken up by government agencies, local bodies, international agencies, voluntary organisations  and  others,  through  separate,  overlapping  and  uncoordinated  interventions. This leads to imbalances in the scale of operations, duplication of e ff orts in some areas, gaps in others and leakage and misuse of resources. Therefore establishing a framework for coordination is necessary for e ff ective recovery. The role of voluntary organisations including   international ones like the Red Cross is extremely useful for mitigating the impact of disaster.

6.5.2 The administration is also required to set up a voluntary organisations' coordination centre to coordinate the relief and rehabilitation activities of the multiple organisations so that they are not concentrated in a few pockets.  It is often observed that post-disaster recovery e ff orts tend to focus on rapid and visible solutions to restore normalcy at the cost of sustainable development. The post-disaster recovery phase provides a 'window of opportunity' for disaster risk reduction. Risk reduction aspects should therefore be built into the redevelopment process.

## 6.6 Shelter

Shelter is one of the most visible and immediate needs in post-crisis settings. Relief e ff orts are often  focused  on  providing  shelter  quickly,  without  taking  into  account  the  impact  of  shortterm shelter strategies. Long-term shelter strategies help not only to focus on determination and implementation of realistic and permanent reconstruction plans for the a ff ected communities, but are also concerned  with rebuilding community con fi dence and support structure for civic responsibility  and  urban  governance,  through  participatory  planning  of  reconstruction.  The development of disaster resistant housing is a major factor in reducing vulnerability to disasters. However,  shelter  issues  in  mitigation  go  beyond  the  structural  aspects.  Rights  to  ownership and  security  of  tenure  make  an  enormous  di ff erence  to  the  maintenance,  management  and development of shelter, particularly in urban areas.

## 6.7 Sustainability in Recovery Process

Normally, it is seen that the recovery e ff orts have a tendency of tapering o ff with the passage of  time.  The  Bureau  for  Crisis  Prevention  and  Recovery  of  the  UNDP  has  also  observed 'the general experience is that once the initial fl urry  of  activities  of  providing  rescue  and  relief  is over, the attention received by the recovery  e ff orts goes on declining steadily over a period  of time and 'business as usual' sets in' . The sustainability component in recovery process therefore is  important. This could be achieved by capability building of the community and awareness generation and preparing local crisis management plans.

## 6.8 Accountability

A system of accountability needs to be evolved during the relief and rehabilitation phase. This system should ensure that the relief material reaches the target groups and that the funds are being utilised e ffi ciently and optimally. A grievance redressal mechanism should also be put in place.

## 6.9 Evaluation

After the recovery phase, it is necessary to conduct a detailed evaluation of all aspects of crisis management. This should bring out the strengths and weaknesses of the disaster management machinery and also provide the basis for future improvements. Such an evaluation should be carried out by an independent professional agency like the NIDM, in all major disasters. This assessment should also include a quick audit of the expenditure incurred.

## 6.10 Guidance Notes on Recovery

The International Recovery Platform (IRP) and United Nations Development Programme India have developed Guidance Notes on Recovery on nine sectors namely Shelter , Infrastructure, Gender,  Livelihood,  Environment,  Governance,  Climate  Change,  Health  and  Psycho-social support.  These  are  initial  steps  in  documenting,  collecting  and  sharing  disaster  recovery experiences  and  lessons. This  collection  of  the  successes  and  failures  of  past  experiences  in disaster recovery is expected to help in the planning and implementation of future recovery initiatives. The aim of the guidance notes is not to recommend actions, but to place before the personnel involved in the risk-reducing recovery process a menu of options. The sector speci fi c Guidance Notes are primarily intended for use by policymakers, planners, and implementers of local, regional and national government bodies interested or engaged in facilitating a more responsive, sustainable, and risk reducing recovery process. Since the governments are not the sole actors in disaster recovery and IRP believes that the experiences collected in this document can bene fi t many other partners working together to build back better. These Guidance Notes on di ff erent sectors are available on their website www.recoveryplatform.org.

## 6.11 Some Indian Experiences in Recovery in the Last Two Decades

Few experiences of post disaster recovery rehabilitation and reconstruction works are illustrated in the subsequent paras. This shows the experiences which country as a whole has gathered in course of its recovery process after the event of di ff erent kind of disasters whether human induced or natural. This may guide the responders in the future such endeavors and may also help them to take corrective measures.

## 6.12 Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984)

6.12.1 The Bhopal Gas Tragedy is one of the world's worst industrial catastrophes. It occurred on the night of 2-3 December, 1984 at the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) Pesticide plant in  Bhopal  which  was  the  Indian  subsidiary  of  Union  Carbide  Corporation,  USA. The  accident occurred  due  to  leakage  of  Methyl  Iso  Cynate  (MIC)  and  other  chemicals  due  to  ingression of water and the resulting reaction a ff ected a large number of persons.  Approximately 2000 people are known to have died in the fi rst 72 hours and large proportion of the survivors su ff ered acute multi-system morbidities (eyes and lungs were the target organs). The ICMR estimated that approximately 62.58% of the total population in Bhopal su ff ered from inhalational toxicity. The people who resided in areas close to the carbide factory were exposed to higher concentration of potentially lethal toxic gases.

6.12.2  A  large  proportion  of  population  who  survived  this  tragedy  developed  morbidity  of varying  degree  over  the  last  25  years.  As  an  immediate  response,  the  state  government  of Madhya Pradesh provided fi nancial support to the a ff ected families and an amount of ' .12.80 crore  was  distributed  as  immediate  relief.  Food  items  were  also  distributed  to  the  a ff ected population and compensation was paid for livestock loss. An amount of   3.78 crore was spent to ' provide compensation to the families of   a deceased.

6.12.3 During 1990 in the fi rst fi ve year action plan a sum of ' 258 Crore was sanctioned by the Central government and it got extended till 1999. This plan provided ' 150.35 crore for medical rehabilitation in addition to economic rehabilitation ( ' 21.18 crore), social rehabilitation ( ' 49.72 crore) and environmental rehabilitation ( ' 23.76 crore). The present action plan for Rehabilitation of Government of Madhya Pradesh is given in Table: 6.1 includes the following features:

## 6.13 Kutch Earthquake (2001)

The Kutch earthquake of 26 th January, 2001 was one of the worst natural disasters to strike in Gujarat.  It posed enormous challenges because of its magnitude, intensity and geographical spread for rescue, relief and rehabilitation.

6.13.1 The devastation -a glimpse: Overall 7633 villages in 21 out of 25 districts of Gujarat were a ff ected to varying degrees. The districts most a ff ected were Kutch, Surendaranagar, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Patan and Ahmedabad. Almost 13, 805 human lives were lost, about 1,67,000 persons

were injured and over a million houses were damaged and destroyed. About 10,000 small and medium industrial  units  went  out  of  production,  a ff ecting  income  and  employment.  Inspite of the immediate sense of shock, confusion, helplessness and grief, the government and the community  rose  to  the  occasion  and  quickly  responded  to  the  event.  Soon  after,  a  holistic and  comprehensive  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  programme  was  put  in  place.  A  new organization, the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority was established. The Government of Gujarat also announced the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Policy (2001).

6.13.2 The Gujarat Earthquake Reconstruction Programme was designed to address the needs of the a ff ected people comprehensively.  It adopted a building back better approach, involved the community and  encompassed a number of sectors such as housing physical infrastructure, social infrastructure (education and health), urban reconstruction, livelihood restoration, social rehabilitation and long term disaster risk reduction.

6.13.3 The reconstruction programme had the following objectives:

- (i) Promoting sustainable recovery in disaster a ff ected areas, and
- (ii) Laying the foundation for sustainable disaster management capacity in Gujarat.

The phase-wise focus of the programme is summarised as follows:

- (a) The short term focus of the reconstruction programme was to address the immediate needs such  as  temporary  shelters  before  the  onset  of  the  monsoon,  debris  removal,  repair  of houses and public buildings and emergency repair of irrigation structures.

- (b) The medium term objectives of the programme emphasised the repair and reconstruction of houses, public infrastructure, and social infrastructure and initiating e ff orts towards disaster mitigation and reduction.
- (c) The  long  term  objective  of  the  reconstruction  programme  was  further  strengthening the  capacity  of  government  institutions  and  community  towards  disaster  risk  reduction (preparedness, response, mitigation and prevention) and implementation of risk transfer mechanism.

6.13.4 Some of the salient features of the Gujarat Reconstruction Programme are as follows:

- (i) Owner Driven Reconstruction: The reconstruction of the houses was done by the owners themselves with technical assistance provided by the government. This involved minimum relocation  and  out  of  215,255  houses  that  were  reconstructed  only  5720  houses  were partially relocated. To provide technical guidance to the community and ensure that the newly built houses were hazard resistant, large number of engineers, architects and masons were trained and technical guidelines were developed. A third party audit mechanism was established to control quality.
- (ii) Housing Insurance: The Housing Insurance Programme was incorporated as a compulsory component for all G-5 houses and optional for houses of other categories.  The insurance covered 14 types of risks for 10 years and the premium was fi xed at ' 349.10 for an insured sum of ' 1 lakh.
- (iii) Urban  reconstruction  of  all  the  four  towns  in  Kutch  ensured  planning  principles  with improvement of basic services and urban environment.
- (iv) A regulatory system for safe construction was strengthened and licensing of engineers and certi fi cation of masons were introduced.
- (v) Mass awareness on disaster preparedness was undertaken to prepare the community to face similar future eventualities.

## 6.15 Kosi Calamity (2008)

6.15.1 The Kosi (known as 'Kaushiki' in Sanskrit) is one of the most ancient rivers of India. The river is notorious for its vagaries and known to change its bed very often.  During the last two centuries, the river has been changing its course in the westerly directions and it has laterally moved nearly 70 miles. On 18.08.2008 the Kosi river started eroding the spurs on the eastern e ffl ux bundh 12 km. up stream of the Birpur barrage in Supaul district and breached the embankment.  After the breach, the entire river spilled out and started fl owing along a new course running straight down south.  The course of the river was approximately 15 to 20 km wide and 150 km long north to south. The entire country side within this 3000 sq. kms. was totally devastated by the rapid surging fl ow of the river along its new course. Houses, schools, roads, dispensaries were all fl ooded and swept away. A total of 35 blocks, 407 panchayats and 980 villages in fi ve districts with a total population of 33, 89, 000 fell along the new course of the river.  Totally, 217 people and 868 cattle were killed and 3,38,986 houses were partly or fully damaged due to the catastrophe.

6.15.2 Immediate Response: The  a ff ected  areas  had  never  experienced  such  a  catastrophe and had not seen fl oods for the last 50 years, therefore they had inadequate arrangements to face the situation. The state administration deployed 1500 boats locally in addition to the 561 motor boats mobilised from NDRF, army, navy and other sources. About 12 helicopters carried out 314 sorties and air dropped about 1, 21, 892 packets of food, water and halogen tablets besides distribution of about 2, 39, 858 food packets by boats to the people in the a ff ected areas.  The state government carried out one of the largest evacuation operations of about 9, 93, 992 persons ever organised in the country.  About 5000 civilian personnel, 3500 police men, 35

columns of army, 4 columns of the navy, 850 personnel of NDRF, 1500 boats and 560 motor boats were deployed for the evacuation.

6.15.3 Mega Shelter Camps: The State Government set up 362 relief camps in the buildings of schools and colleges.  At the peak of the disaster 4, 40,739 people were living in the camps.  Self help groups were constituted to look after the preparation and distribution of meals.  A special thrust was on women and newly born babies;  clothes and utensils were given to each camp inmate as relief measures. Other features of the shelter are outlined below:

- · A total of 3,750 temporary toilets constructed,  2,155  hand  pumps  installed in  the  camps,  generators  and  solar  lamps provided for lighting in the camps,
- · Schools set up for the children in the camp and 56,304 children enrolled in these schools,
- · Anganwadi  Centres  set  up  in  each  major camp,
- · Skill development programmes  initiated and training provided to willing persons in handicrafts and cottage industries,

6.15.4 Livestock: To  cater  to  the  a ff ected  livestock,  257  veterinary  centres  manned  by  387 personnel were set up.  As per the report 47,430 animals were kept in camps and 321630 animals were vaccinated.

## Box 6. 2: Kosi Flood Reconstruction And Rehabilitation Programme

Background: The  state  government  has  formulated  Kosi  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project with the purpose of reconstructing the houses, providing community facilities, complete restoration of physical infrastructure, livelihood support based on the policy of sustained economy and environment etc for the people a ff ected by the calamity. The project is based on the success of the pilot Kosi Recovery and Reconstruction project supported by the UNDP in two villages through the Owner Driven Reconstruction Collaborative network of civil society organisations.

Components: The  World  Bank  aided  project  Kosi  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project  has  the following major components:

- (i) Owner Driven  Housing  Reconstruction  Using  an  owner  driven  reconstruction  model,  about 1000,000  houses  will  be  built  with  a  brick  and  concrete  plinth,  bamboo  superstructure  and corrugated galvanized iron (CGI) sheeting roof. The cost per house will be ' 55,000 with a currently estimated cost of ' 2,300 for a toilet and ' 5,000) for solar powered   lighting.
- (ii) Reconstruction  of  Roads  and  Bridges  Under  this  component,  connectivity  lost  due  to  the Kosi fl ood would be restored by reconstruction of damaged roads and bridges/culverts, including construction of some new bridges. The project is expected to construct about 90 bridges and culverts on the State Highway and Major District Roads and reconstruct about 290 km of rural roads, which would bene fi t around 2.2 million people. New cross drainage structures will be provided where new streams have formed and where these were missing earlier.
- (iii) Strengthening  Flood  Management  Capacity  This  component  would  strengthen  the  overall fl ood forecasting and fl ood and sediment management capacity in Bihar by enhancing knowledge, understanding,  and  capacity  of fl ood  and  sediment  management.  This  will  be  achieved  by implementing both structural and non-structural   measures, mainly focusing on the Kosi River Basin. The component has three subcomponents:
- a. Knowledge management and capacity building;
- b. Flood forecasting and early warning; and
- c. Structural investments.
- (iv) Livelihood  Restoration  and  Enhancement -  The  component  is  to  build  social  and fi nancial capital and expand the livelihood opportunities of the a ff ected people of Madhepura, Supaul and Saharsa. This component will have four subcomponents: (i) Community Institution Development; (ii) Community Investment Fund; (iii) Technical Assistance Fund; and (iv) Project Management.
- (v) Improving  Emergency  Response  Capacity  This  component  aims  at  making  contingency funding available for civil works, consultant services and goods required to respond in case of future emergencies.
- (vi) Project  Management  and  Implementation  Support  This  component  is  to  support  project implementation through the provision of necessary o ffi ces including equipment.

Finance: Total  Cost of the World bank aided project formulated by the Government is $220 million about ' 1,000 crores.

## 6.16 Leh Cloudburst (2010)

6.16.1 A rare phenomenon, a rainfall of 12.8mm during the intervening night of 5/6th August 2010 coupled with cloud burst resulted in fl ash fl oods and mud slides causing havoc and large scale loss of life and public infrastructure/private property particularly in Leh region. Besides the

such as tents, blankets, tarpaulins, mattresses, food packets and bottled water were provided. Contributions from the charitable organisations and other sources were also sent. Apart from the medical teams available with army, CPMFs, state, etc. one medical team consisting of 08 Doctors and 04 Nurses along with 10 quintals of emergent surgical/medical consumables were deployed in the a ff ected area from Delhi. Additional medical supplies and medical equipments were sent to the a ff ected areas. A total of 55 civil aircrafts were operated and more than 8000 people were evacuated. The Air Force also carried out 226 sorties and airlifted 302 tonnes of relief material and equipments and 818 persons. Funds to the tune of ' 429.24 crore ($ 95 million) were available with the state government in their State Disaster Response Fund for undertaking immediate relief activities. The Prime Minister announced a rehabilitation package of ' 125 crore ($ 30 million).

6.16.3 Lesson learnt: The gap in the response to the remote hilly area and the disaster being of unprecedented requires strengthening of the National Emergent Reserve and placing it at similar vulnerable areas for prompt relief. Besides there is an urgent need to strengthen the communication system i.e. multi modal system and create an awareness among people about the cloud burst and its consequences.

## 6.17 Mayapuri Radiation Exposure Delhi (2010)

6.17.1 The  National  Radiation  Regulatory  Authority,  Atomic  Energy  Regulatory  Board  (AERB) received a message in the afternoon of 7 th April, 2010 from Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi that one person, aged 32 years, the owner of a scrap shop in Mayapuri Industrial Area, New Delhi had been admitted on 4 th April, 2010 with symptoms of radiation exposure.

## Box 6.3: Recovery an Opportunity

Disaster can become a development opportunity if relief e ff orts do not merely restore the poor status quo ante, but rather put people on a path of sustainable development. The goal in the transition phase must be to avoid a 'circularity of risk' . This is what can happen when houses built with valuable international assistance get washed away during fl oods, dams left unrepaired after an earthquake aggravate drought conditions,  and  procedural  delays  in  receiving  rehabilitation  packages  from  government  and  donor agencies leave the poor more vulnerable to the next disaster.

6.17.2 The Team of Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) visited the place immediately with radiation detection equipments and monitored the radiation levels at various positions near the scrap shop. They found that the particular shop as well as a couple of nearby shops had very high radiation fi elds.  Next day, teams of Radiation Safety Experts from BARC, AERB &amp; Narora Atomic Power Station were sent to Delhi with a wide range of radiation monitoring, detecting equipments and a lead fl ask to locate, identify, recover, safely  secure and dispose radioactive sources.

6.17.3 The response team identi fi ed the radiation source as Cobalt-60, used mainly in industry for radiography and in teletherapy for cancer treatment.  During the search operation, the team could locate, recover and secure eight sources of di ff erent intensities.  These sources were placed in the lead shielded fl ask brought from Narora and sent for further examination and safe disposal. Subsequently the area was cleared for the public. A radiation survey of scrap metal shops in neighboring areas was carried out following the incident.  It indicated elevated radiation levels in one more scrap shop about 500 m away from the ones where radiation sources were found

earlier.  A joint team consisting of AERB and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) recovered two more radioactive sources from this  shop.    Both  the  sources  were  safely  transferred  to  a shielding fl ask and transported back to Narora.

6.17.4 As a follow up to this incident, four joint teams of BARC, AERB and NDRF were formed and the surroundings of all remaining 800 shops in the market were scanned when the shops were closed on 14 th April, 2010.  The entire area was found to be free of elevated radiation fi elds except at the entrance of the market where the soil over a small patch was slightly contaminated.   The contaminated soil showed Cobalt-60 contamination but of very low order. Subsequently, the contaminated soil up to a depth of few centimetres was removed to bring down the radiation fi eld.

6.17.5 Constitution of a Working Group: In the backdrop of the discovery of radiation sources from the scrap in Mayapuri in New Delhi and also to minimise the possibility of such recurrences in future, NDMA constituted a working group headed by Shri B. Bhattacharjee, Member, NDMA to  spell  out  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  various  agencies  in  dealing  with  Radiological Emergencies.    The  committee  has  submitted  its  report  with  the  title  'Working  Group  for Formulating mechanisms to detect, prevent and respond to radiological emergencies in India' to the Cabinet Secretariat. Further follow up on the recommendations of the committee is being done by the Cabinet Secretariat and NDMA.

## 6.18 Conclusion

Recovery, early recovery, long-term recovery, lasting recovery, reconstruction and rehabilitation are critical phases of Disaster Management Cycle. They o ff er an opportunity to reduce risks from future hazards and the 'Build back better' approach followed in the recovery programmes after major recent disasters give us valuable lessons on how to approach this phase. It is anticipated that the experiences mentioned would help the stakeholders in planning e ff ective, e ffi cient and time bound action plan in the event of disasters.

## 7.1 An Overview

E ff ective  disaster  management  requires  trained  manpower  to  deal  with  complex  situations e ff ectively and speedily to reduce the impact of disaster on human life and property. It is necessary to continuously undertake measures to build capacity amongst those who are handling disaster prevention,  mitigation,  preparedness,  response,  reconstruction  and  also  creating  awareness amongst people.  Therefore, capacity building needs to encompass all resources available within a community, society and organisation to reduce the level of risk or the e ff ects of a disaster.

## 7.2 De fi nition

UNDP describes 'capacity building' as the creation of an enabling environment with appropriate policy and legal frameworks, institutional development, including community participation (of women in particular), human resource development and strengthening of managerial systems. It  adds  that  capacity  building  is  a  long-term,  continuing  process,  in  which  all  stakeholders participate  (ministries,  local  authorities,  non-governmental  organisations  and  water  user association's professional associations, academics and others). Capacity may include physical, institutional, social or economic means as well as skilled personal or collective attributes such as leadership and management. Capacity may also be described as capability.

## 7.2.1 Capacity building 31 is much more than training and includes the following:

- · Human resource development, the process of equipping individuals with the understanding, skills  and  access  to  information,  knowledge  and  training  that  enables  them  to  perform e ff ectively,
- · Organisational  development,  the  elaboration  of  management  structures,  processes  and procedures,  not  only  within  organisations  but  also  the  management  of  relationships between the di ff erent organisations and sectors (public, private and community),
- · Institutional  and legal framework development, making legal and regulatory changes to enable organisations, institutions and agencies at all levels and in all sectors to enhance their capacities.

## 7.2.2 Following are considered as vital components of the capacity development:

- (i) Training: It is a learning process that involves the acquisition of knowledge,  sharpening of skills, concepts, rules, or change of attitude and behavior to enhance the performance of individuals associated with di ff erent departments and institutions.
- (ii) Education: Amidst changes of the past decades,  school education sector, the most discussed topic  of  national  importance,  is  planning  for  more  contextual,  practical  and  application oriented curriculum for students at di ff erent levels of schooling.
- (iii) Research: Research is an organised and systematic way of fi nding answers to questions. Systematic because there are certain things in the research process which are always done in order to get most accurate result.
- (iv) Awareness: Awareness  is  generally  de fi ned  as  knowledge  created  through  interaction between an agent and its environment. It cannot be simply referred to as 'knowing what is  going  on.' This  concept  of  awareness  involves  state  of  knowledge  as  well  as  dynamic processes of perception and action.

## 7.3  Approach

7.3.1 The National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM) describes its approach to capacity development.  A  strategic  approach  to  capacity  development  can  be  addressed  e ff ectively only with the active and enthusiastic participation of the stakeholders. This process comprises of  awareness generation, education, training, research and development (R&amp;D) etc. It further addresses to put in  place  an  appropriate  institutional  framework,  management  systems  and allocation  of  resources  for  e ffi cient  prevention  and  handling  of  disasters.  The  approach  to capacity development includes-

- · According priority to training for developing community based DM systems for their specific needs in view of the regional diversities and multi-hazard vulnerabilities,
- · Conceptualisation of community based DM systems at the national level through a consultative process involving the States and other stakeholders with the state and local level authorities in charge of implementation,
- · Identification of knowledge-based institutions with proven performance,
- · Promotion of International and Regional cooperation,
- · Adoption of traditional and global best practices and technologies,
- · Laying emphasis on table-top exercises, simulations, mock drills and development of skills to test the plans,
- · Capacity analysis of different disaster responder groups at State, District, and local levels.

7.3.2 NPDM has further elaborated on national priorities, institutional capacity development, training  of  communities,  professional  technical  education,  DM  education  in  schools,  training of artisans, training of other groups and licensing and certi fi cation. Besides NPDM guidelines issued by NDMA also lay emphasis on capacity development.

- 7.3.3 Capacity development in India :  A realistic National Capacity Development Programme, commensurate with the intensity and extent of the hazard in India needs to be evolved and implemented, keeping in view the available resources. This programme of resource enhancement should encompass all institutions,organizations and individuals that have a role in any part of the disaster management cycle.

7.3.4 Capacity gaps in disaster management : To mitigate the impact of disasters, there is a need to work collectively through multidimensional channels combining the e ff orts, resources and expertise of the government, non- governmental organisations and civil societies. Managing such incidents holistically is a highly specialised and skilled job which cannot be approached in an ad hoc manner. Disaster Management comprises of multi sectoral issues and accordingly calls for all sectors that play pivotal role in managing exigencies to develop their human resource capacity accordingly. There seems to exist a wide gap in the knowledge, skill, and attitude of the disaster managers for e ffi ciently managing emergency situations particularly at local and state level where according to one study made by NIDM, Capacity-Risk ratio is remarkably low. To bridge this gap, it is important to have speci fi c capacity development plans and strategies.

7.3.5 Target group: In the fi eld of capacity development, priority is to be given to training of DM o ffi cials, functionaries, trainers and elected representatives and community representatives. Due importance requires to be given to DM training and orientation of professionals like doctors, engineers and architects apart from those engaged in response and relief. DM training further

requires  to  be  included  in  curricula  of  educational  institutions  at  all  levels  of  schooling  and should include practical instructions as well.

7.3.6 Realizing the importance of Capacity Development of stakeholders in Disaster Management, NIDM has been given the task of preparing National Human Resource and Capacity Development plan, which is at the advanced stage of its formulation. The fi rst draft has been prepared and presented before the MHA. NIDM is fi nalizing the plan after holding the discussion with MHA on its fi rst draft.

## Institutions for Capacity Development

## 7.4 National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM)

7.4.1 Background: In the backdrop of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR), a National Centre for Disaster Management was established at IIPA in 1995. The Centre was upgraded and designated as the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) on 16 th October 2003 and it has now achieved the status of a statutory organisation under the National Disaster Management Act, 2005. Section 42 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 entrusts the institute with various responsibilities, namely to develop training modules, undertake research and documentation in disaster management, organise training programmes, undertake and organise study courses, conferences, lectures and seminars to promote and institutionalise disaster management, undertake and provide for publication of journals, research papers and books.  Located centrally at the Indraprastha Estate on the Mahatma Gandhi Road, within the campus of the IIPA,  the  institute  is  equipped  with  state-of-the-art  facilities  of  training  and research on disaster management. It has training and conference halls, well stocked library, GIS laboratory, computer centre, and video conferencing facility. The institute also provides boarding and lodging facilities for participants during its programmes.

7.4.2 Training Programmes of NIDM: The di ff erent formats in which training is imparted by NIDM include:

- (i) Face-to-face training: NIDM conducts both in campus and o ff -campus training programmes. In-campus programmes are conducted in the premises of the Institute while the o ff -campus programmes are conducted mostly in state capitals, at the premises of the Administrative Training Institutes.  It conducts as many as 92 training programmes on diversi fi ed themes of disaster management, with many new programmes added continually.  The participants of these programmes are usually middle and senior level government o ffi cers nominated by the state governments and concerned ministries and departments of the Government of  India.  The  programmes  constitute  class  room  lectures  and  presentations, fi eld  visits, group exercises, panel discussions etc.  It does not charge any course fees. Boarding and lodging arrangements are also made free of charge. During the year 2010-11, the institute has conducted 84 training programmes, which have been attended by 2142 participants.
- (ii) Web- based training: In collaboration with World Bank Institute, Washington, the Institute conducts  on-line  training  programmes  on  basic  and  specialised  subjects  on  disaster management. The courses are open to all interested persons with a token charge of ' 1500 for the basic course of one and half months and ' 1000 for specialised courses of one month duration to cover the cost of reading materials, postage etc. Every participant is expected to  take  part  in  on-line  discussions.  The  successful  candidates  are  awarded  certi fi cates

## Disaster Management in India

signed  jointly  by  the  NIDM  and  WBI.  In  2010-11,  three  online  training  programmes on  Comprehensive  Disaster  Risk  Management  Framework  and  four  specialised  online programmes on Community Based Disaster Risk Management, Climate Change and Disaster Management, Risk Sensitive Land Use Planning and Safe Cities have been organized. A total of over 438 participants attended these online courses. The Institute has also started the process of customisation of eight modules to Indian context.

- (iii) Satellite  based  training: The  Institute  has  collaborated  with  Administrative  Training Institutes,  Bhopal  and  Mysore  to  conduct  satellite  based  training  programmes  through the ISRO community centres that have satellite based one-way video and two-way audio communication system. More than hundred centres join the programme simultaneously in which thousands of grassroots level functionaries take part. The Institute is extending the programmes in number of other states where similar facilities have been seen set up.
- (iv) Self study courses: The Institute is in the process of launching web based training courses on  various  themes  such  as  basics  of  disaster  management,  earthquake, fl ood,  cyclone, disaster management for civil defence volunteers, public health workers, school children and community preparedness, which anyone from anywhere at any time can log on. The aim of such courses is to create interest and raise the level of awareness of people regarding disaster management and in some cases supplement the existing class room based training programmes.
- (v) India Disaster Management Congress: NIDM has taken the lead in organizing the India Disaster Management Congress (IDMC) on the pattern of India Science Congress to bring together scientists, scholars and practitioners from diverse disciplines on the same platform. The fi rst such Congress was held in November 2006 which was inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister of India. The Institute organized the Second India Disaster Management Congress in November 2009. The congress had twenty six thematic sessions around twelve di ff erent thematic clusters where over 300 technical papers were presented. Hon'ble Shri APJ Abdul Kalam, Former President of India graced the occasion and delivered the valedictory address.
- (vi) Capacity  Building  Programme  for  Engineers  and  Architects  in  Earthquake  Risk Management: Ministry of Home A ff airs initiated this twin programmes for capacity building of  engineers (National Programme for Capacity Building of Engineers in Earthquake Risk Management)  and  architects  (National  Programme  for  Capacity  Building  of  Architects in  Earthquake  Risk  Management)  at  the  cost  of ' 12.36  and  . ' 4.51  crore  respectively  in earthquake risk management. The  programme which started in 2004-05 was implemented till 2008 by the MHA and has subsequently been transferred to the  NIDM for implementation with e ff ect from 01.4.2008.

## 7.5  National Disaster Management Authority

7.5.1 NDMA undertakes several initiatives in the process of capacity development. Few of them are illustrated as follows:

- 7.5.2 Mock Exercises: NDMA undertakes mock exercises in vulnerable districts and industries on  various  types  of  natural  and  man-made  disasters  to  help  the  state  governments  and district administration in reviewing the adequacy and e ffi cacy of the state and district level Disaster Management Plans and to identify gaps in resources and systems. So far NDMA has

conducted nearly 211 mock exercises including 90 similar  exercises  in  schools.  During  the Commonwealth Games, similar exercises were under taken through coordinated conferences, table  top  exercises  and  the  mock  exercises  on  both  natural  and  man-made  disasters  at di ff erent  competition  and  practice  venues  and  at  accommodation  areas  of  players  and accompanying o ffi cials. Altogether, 55 such exercises were conducted at di ff erent venues of the Commonwealth Games including the Games Village.

7.5.3 Mock Exercises on School Safety: Mock exercises in schools are conducted to empower the schools to face the disasters squarely before the specialist response is a ff ected. Details are given in the Table 7.1.

## E ff orts of other Ministries in Capacity Development Programme on DM:

## 7.11 Ministry of Human Resource Development:

7.11.1 As an e ff ort to mainstream disaster management concerns into the education curricula, NDMA has taken the initiative in conjunction with the Ministry of Human Resource Development, to ensure that DM curriculum forms part of the course curriculum in undergraduate science and humanities courses and medical, engineering, architecture courses besides in school education. It  will  also  focus  on  the  training  of  teachers  and  faculties  in  disaster  management.  Sarva Siksha Abhiyaan (SSA) will also include the concerns of disaster resilience in their adult literacy curriculum.

## 7.11.2 The topics on Disaster Management aim to:

- i. Acquaint students about various disasters that India is vulnerable to and the hazard maps to enable them to visualize these vulnerabilities,
- ii. Introduce a few key concepts in disaster management in simple terms, to orient them to the words used in media discussions, analysis etc. when a disaster strikes,
- iii. Introduce the concept of being prepared for disaster through simple do-s and don'ts that school children can imbibe and spread to families and community,
- iv. Develop interest in the subject through interactive activities in the classroom so that the student seeks more information on disaster.

7.11.3 Syllabus of di ff erent classes from VIII th to XI th The Central Board of Secondary Education has taken the initiative of including disaster management topics as frontline curriculum in the subject of social science with e ff ect from 2003-2004 in class VIII th and extended it to class IX th and X th in subsequent years. It was extended to class XI in 2005-2006 in the subjects of sociology and geography.

DM syllabus are being introduced in universities. Pune ,Madras, IGNOU, and Indraprastha  and many other Universities  has already started such courses and it is in the process of getting introduced in Symbiosis, Pune.

7.11.4 NDMA has undertaken to get such courses introduced in undergraduate course. A module has been provided to UGC similarly for introducing such courses in technical institutes. Modules have been provided to AICTE in course of Engineering and architect. ICAR has introduced a DM module for its courses in Agriculture and Vetenary

7.11.5 Organisation of training programme: With the fi nancial and technical support from Ministry of Home A ff airs and the UNDP under the GOI\_UNDP DRM programme (2002-2009), the Central Board of Secondary Education was able to successfully complete two master trainers programmes across the country during the year 2003-2006.These training programme helped the teachers to successfully transect the subject in the class room. Demonstrations were carried out on fi rst aid, search and rescue, evacuation etc by the health department, fi re services etc. An impact study on disaster management textbooks was conducted by CBSE in July, 2006 with the purpose of updating the textual material by incorporating recent developments and obtaining feedback from the teacher and students.,. Feedback questionnaires were sent to 180 schools all over the country. The information received from schools was analyzed with the purpose of reviewing and updating the existing text books.

## 7.12 Ministry of Panchayati Raj &amp; Rural Development

NDMA has advised the Ministry of Panchayati Raj and Rural Development to address the concerns of disaster management in the training of representatives of the Panchayati Raj Institutions and local bodies. The Ministry of Panchayati Raj has also issued a letter N-11012/35/2007-P&amp;J Vol III

dated 1.9.2010 in this regard. Accordingly, all the ongoing and future projects of this ministry should  incorporate  disaster  resilient  features  into  them.  States  e ff orts'  towards  training  of Panchayati Raj functionaries and district level o ffi cials has been initiated in 11 states in association with IGNOU. Altogether 4,125 government functionaries and 12,375 PRI/ ULB representatives are targeted to be trained in disaster management under this project.

## 7.13 Conclusions

7.13.1 Disaster management requires trained human resources to deal with complex situation e ff ectively to mitigate the impact of disaster on human life and property. Capacity Development is an integral process of knowledge and skill building. Capacity may include physical, institutional, social or economic means as well as skilled personal or collective attributes such as leadership and management. Capacity Development is much more then training and it includes human resource development, equipping individual with understanding, skills and access to information, knowledge and training that enables him to perform e ff ectively.

7.13.2  National  Policy  on  Disaster  Management  (NPDM)  describes  its  approach  to  capacity development. NPDM further elaborates on National priorities, institutional capacity development, training communities, professional technical education, DM education in school, training to artisan and training to other group. Capacity development has focused on training of the DM o ffi cials, functionaries, trainers, elected representatives and community representatives.

## 8.3. National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF)

8.3.1 Section 46(1) of DM Act 2005 provides for constitution of NDRF for meeting any threatening disaster management situation or disaster. Accordingly, DM Division issued noti fi cation for the constitution of NDRF on 28 th September 2010. The Finance Ministry has also issued guidelines to the state for operation of NDRF.

8.3.2 Sourcing of National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF): The Government of India raised this Fund by levying the 'National Calamity Contingency Duty' on imported petrol and products, crude oil, motor cars, imported multi utility vehicles, two wheelers, mobile phones, pan masala and certain speci fi c tobacco products. The collection for year 2009-10 was ' 3160.00 crore and was expected to be around ' 3900.00 crore in the fi nancial year 2010-2011. For the year 2011-12, the estimate is ' 4525.00 crores.

8.3.3 Additional Financial Assistance: Over and above the provisions of the SDRF, funding is provided from the NDRF in the wake of calamities of severe nature. On receipt of the memorandum from the a ff ected states, an Inter Ministerial Central Team comprising of representatives of the central  ministries/  departments  is  constituted  and  its  report  after  examination  by  the  Inter Ministerial Group (IMG) headed by Home Secretary is placed before the High Level Committee (HLC) for their consideration and approval of funds from NDRF. The composition of HLC is given in the Policy and Guideline, Chapter-2, which at present are headed by Finance Minister with Home Minister, Minister for Agriculture and Vice Chairman of Planning Commission as its member on the committee.

## 8.4 Monitoring of Expenditure from Relief Funds

The Ministry of Home A ff airs oversees the operations of SDRF and monitors its compliance with these guidelines. A format for monitoring the relief expenditure in accordance with the extant items and norms of assistance has been prescribed. A web based computerized tracking system has also been developed for monitoring the relief expenditure.  The Accountant General of the State maintains the accounts of the SDRF. The Comptroller &amp; Auditor General of India audits SDRF every year.

## 8.5 Disaster Response Reserve

In the context of disaster relief, the 13th Finance Commission has observed that procurement of relief materials on short notice is often associated with premium in pricing and could adversely impact quality. The Commission also felt that a national inventory of equipment and material should be maintained for providing immediate relief. It is advisable to keep an inventory of items such as life saving equipment and tents etc. with the NDRF. The Commission has accordingly recommended an initial grant of ' .250.00 crores in the form of a revolving fund to be provided to the NDRF for this purpose. Whenever these items are used for responding to a calamity, the cost (or rent for those items that can be reused) should be booked to the overall cost of relief operations incurred by the state government and the inventory replenished on a regular basis. A proposal to constitute this fund along with guidelines for its operations is under consideration of the government.

## 8.6 Capacity Building Grant

On the recommendation of the 13 th Finance Commission, ' 525.00 crore has been allocated to the states for taking up activities for building capacity in the administrative machinery. The state wise allocation for the period 2010-15 is given in Table No- 8.2. The Ministry of Finance has issued the guidelines for the utilization of the fund. The guidelines provide for preparation of an action plan for the entire period of 2010-15 as well as action plans for each fi nancial year. These plans would inter  alia  include  items  for  training  and  capacity  building  of  stakeholders  and  functionaries  in states, preparation of disaster management plans based on hazard, risk and vulnerability analysis and setting up and strengthening of emergency operations centres in states.

The present Items and Norms of assistance for relief may be visited www.mha.nic.in.

## 8.13 Conclusion

While the post disaster relief and reconstruction is resource intensive, the Government has taken care to ensure that there are established fi nancial mechanisms available both at the state and central level to address the resource requirements for such eventualities. The present scheme of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) are based on the recommendation of 13 th fi nance commission operated from 1 st  April 2010 to 31 st March 2015. For disasters needing central support over and above the SDRF, the processing of the request of the state government for support from the Government of India  is done by Ministry of Home A airs (DM Division) while  the budgetary provisions for  the relief funds is dealt with by the ff Ministry of Finance. It is to be noted that the funds have also been allocated for strengthening of  Disaster  Management  Institutions,  Capacity  Development  of  stakeholder's,  prevention  &amp; mitigation and the response mechanism. E ff orts are also underway to ensure that the mitigation and prevention of disaster are also given adequate importance by utilizing these funds so that the impact of the disasters is minimized.

## 9.3 Agencies of United Nations involved in Disaster Management

There are various UN organizations engaged in the fi eld of disaster management. Many of such organisation have direct linkages with UN's mainstream body, where as other's are evolved and are developed from the region of Asia, which have been most vulnerable to earthquake and cyclone. India has been actively involved in their setting up besides being members on the basis of its full time membership. A brief overview of such organizations has been presented in the following paras:

## 9.4 United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)

9.4.1  At  the  end  of  the  International  Decade  for  Natural  Disaster  Reduction  in  July  1999,  the International Programme Forum adopted the Geneva Mandate on Disaster Reduction, together with  the  strategy  document,  'The  Forum  recommended  that  in  international  cooperative framework for disaster reduction be maintained and strengthened.

9.4.2 In December 1999, General Assembly Resolution 54/219 created the UNISDR, as a successor of the secretariat of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, in 2001. Assembly resolution 56/195 mandated the secretariat to serve as the focal point in the United Nations System for the coordination of disaster reduction and to ensure synergies among the disaster reduction activities of the United Nations Systems and regional organizations and activities in socio-economic and humanitarian fi eld

9.4.3 In 2005, the assembly, through resolution 60/195, endorsed the' Hyogo Declaration' and 'Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and communities to  Disaster'  adopted  by  the  world  conference  on  Disaster  Reduction,  held  in  Kobe,  Hyogo, Japan. The Hyogo Framework for Action has tasked the ISDR Secretariat with supporting the implementation for the strategic objectives identi fi ed therein.

9.4.4 Mission: In order to build the resilience of nations and communities to disasters through the  implementation  of  the  HFA  ,  the  UNISDR    strives  to  catalyze,  facilitate  and  mobilise  the commitment  and  resources  of  national,  regional  and  international  stakeholders  of  the  ISDR system.

9.4.5 The mission of UNISDR is to be an e ff ective coordinator and guide  all its ISDR partners, globally and regionally, to:

- · Mobilise political and fi nancial commitments to disaster risk reduction and Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters (HFA);
- · Develop and sustain a robust, multi stake-holder system;
- · Provide relevant knowledge and guidance.

9.4.6 Functions and Responsibilities: The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) was adopted by United Nations Member States in 2000 and is owned by local, national, regional and international  organisations.  UNISDR  is  led  by  an  Assistant  Secretary-General  for  Disaster Risk Reduction and overseen by the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian A ff airs, who also serves as the Chair for the wider ISDR system of partnerships. The mandate of UNISDR is to act as the focal point in the United Nations system for the coordination of disaster reduction and to ensure that disaster risk reduction becomes integral part to sound and equitable development, environmental protection and humanitarian action.

9.4.7 ISDR mechanisms: The various mechanisms have been developed to achieve the mission which are enumerated  as follows:

- · The  biennial  Global  Platform  for  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  (GFDRR)  acts  as  the  main  global forum for continued and concerted emphasis on disaster reduction. Open to all states and the  ISDR stakeholders, it primarily assesses the progress made in the implementation of the HFA, enhances awareness of disaster risk reduction, share experiences and learn from good practices, also identify remaining gaps and necessary actions to accelerate national and local implementation;

## Disaster Management in India

- · It acts as Regional platforms for disaster risk reduction, including ministerial meetings, led by regional inter-governmental organisations.
- · As an Inter-Agency Group it acts as a venue for ISDR system joint work programming among the participating organisations (currently FAO, IFRC, ILO, OCHA, UNDP , UNEP , UNESCO, UNICEF, WFP, WHO, WMO and the World Bank). Thematic platforms led by UN specialised agencies or technical institutions provide knowledge products and help to report on developments (for instance early warning, recovery, education, risk identi fi cation) etc.
- · The Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian A ff airs also convenes a Management Oversight Board with his peers (from OCHA; UNDP representing UNDG; the World Bank; WMO; UNEP; and IFRC). This Board supports the Chair in providing UN system-wide leadership and highlevel advocacy for disaster risk reduction.
- · Several  stakeholder  groups  and  networks  associated  with  ISDR  -  among  them  include  a Scienti fi c Technical Committee, Global NGO Network for DRR, Gender-and-Disasters, media groupings,  an  emerging  Parliamentarian  Network  and  member  state,  which  participate actively  in  ISDR,  are  called  upon  in  GA  and  HFA  resolution  to  establish  multi  stakeholder national platform for disaster risk reduction to facilitate coordination across sector.

## 9.5. United Nation Disaster Management Team (UNDMT)

The UNDMT in India is a team comprising of UN agencies such as FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization),  ILO  (International  Labour  Organization),  UNDP  (United  Nations  Development Programme), UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scienti fi c and Cultural Organization), UNFPA (United  Nations  Population  Fund),  UNHCR  (United  Nations  High  Commission  for  Refugees), UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund), WFP (World Food Programme) and WHO (World Health Organization).

## 9.5.1 The primary purpose of the UNDMT in India is

- · To  ensure  a  prompt,  e ff ective  and  concerted  country-level  support  to  a  governmental response in the event of a disaster, at the central, state and sub-state levels,
- · To coordinate UN assistance to the government with respect to long term recovery, disaster mitigation and preparedness,
- · To coordinate all disaster-related activities, technical advice and material assistance provided by UN agencies, as well as to take steps for optimal utilisation of resources by UN agencies.

9.5.2 UNDMT works very closely with the nodal ministries of the member agencies and provides support as per the established procedures. UNDMT joined the Asian Development Bank and World Bank to do an assessment of the reconstruction requirements after the tsunami in 2004 and Kashmir Earthquake in 2005.  Based on the joint assessment of the damages in the tsunami a ff ected states, UN formulated 'Tsunami Recovery Programme' to support the tsunami a ff ected states in their recovery and reconstruction programmes.  UNDMT and NDMA have constituted a working group to undertake some pilot joint initiatives on various aspects of DM.

## 9.6 United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC)

9.6.1 The  United  Nations  Disaster  Assessment  and  Coordination  (UNDAC) team is a stand-by team  of  disaster  management  professionals  which  are  nominated  and  funded  by  member

governments,  OCHA,  UNDP  and  operational  humanitarian  United  Nations  Agencies  such  as World  Food  Programme  (WFP),  United  Nations  Children's  Fund  (UNICEF)  and  World  Health Organization (WHO). UNDAC is designed to assist the United Nations and governments of a disaster-a ff ected  country  in  meeting  international  needs  for  early  and  quali fi ed  information during the fi rst phase of a sudden-onset of emergency as well as in the coordination of incoming international relief at the national level and/or at the site of the emergency.

9.6.2 The UNDAC Team is a United Nations Team of multi-national personnel trained in disaster management for rapid assessment of priority needs and on-site coordination of international assistance. The team members are international disaster/emergency managers from all parts of  the  world.  Under  the  UNDAC  System,  whenever  a  major  disaster  strikes  a  country  and international  assistance  is  warranted,  the  O ffi ce  of  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  A ff airs (OCHA) deputes a team of experts trained in the UNDAC system to carry out an assessment of the requirements for assistance as well as coordinating such assistance with the host country. UN OCHA have empanelled and trained o ffi cers worldwide including o ffi cers from India. Upon request of a disaster-stricken country, the UNDAC team can be deployed within hours to carry out rapid assessment of priority needs and to support national authorities and the United Nations Resident Coordinator to coordinate international relief on-site.

9.6.3 O ffi cers trained under the UNDAC system ( who have attended the UNDAC Induction and Refresher courses) are on contract with the UNDAC for a period of two years (a token amount of 1 USD per year is given to the O ffi cer) after some documentary formalities. After the expiry of the contract, it has to be renewed. Such o ffi cers are known as Active members in the UN OCHA parlance and they are liable to be requisitioned for disaster assessment by the UN OCHA in any disaster a ff ected country.

9.6.4  The Government of India have joined the membership of United Nations Disaster Assessment &amp; Coordination (UNDAC) system and has paid, an amount of US$ 50,000 (Fifty thousand) in 2001, with UNOCHA the implementing body of UNDAC programmes.

## 9.7 United Nations O ffi ce for the Coordination of Humanitarian A ff airs (UNOCHA)

9.7.1 The  United  Nations  O ffi ce  for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  A ff airs  (UNOCHA)  is  a United Nations body formed in December 1991 by the General Assembly resolution 46/182. The resolution was designed to strengthen the response of UNO to complex emergencies and natural disasters by creating the Department of Humanitarian A ff airs (DHA), and replacing the O ffi ce of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator, which had been formed in 1972. The OCHA was therefore the result of a 1998 reorganization of the DHA and was designed to be the UN focal point on major disasters. Its mandate was also expanded to include the coordination of humanitarian response, policy development and humanitarian advocacy. OCHA is thus an interagency body, serving UN agencies and NGOs in the humanitarian domain. Its main product is the Consolidated Appeals Process, an advocacy and planning tool to deliver humanitarian assistance together in a given emergency.

9.7.2 OCHA is headed by the Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian A ff airs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. OCHA has 1,064 sta ff located across the world. Major OCHA country o ffi ces are  located  in  Afghanistan,  Burundi,  Central  African  Republic,  Chad,  Colombia,  Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Palestinian territories, Sri Lanka  and Sudan (including a sub-o ffi ce in Southern Sudan's capital Juba), while regional o ffi ces are located in Panama City,

Dakar, Cairo, Johannesburg, and Bangkok. OCHA also has some liaison and support sta ff in New York and Geneva.

## 9.8 International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG)

9.8.1 INSARAG  is  a  global  network of more  than 80 countries and  disaster response organizations  under  the  United  Nations  umbrella. INSARAG  deals  with  urban  search  and rescue  (USAR)  related issues.  INSARAG  aims  at establishing  standards  for  international  USAR teams and methodology for international coordination in earthquake response. Members of INSARAG are both earthquake-prone and responding countries and organisations. INSARAG was established in 1991, following initiatives of international search and rescue teams that responded to the 1988 Armenia earthquake.

9.8.2 INSARAG Structure: INSARAG policy is determined by its Steering Group  The Steering . Group  meets  annually  to  review  achievements  and    areas  of  improvement.  It  is  composed of  representatives  from  each  INSARAG  Regional  Group  (Africa,  Europe,  Asia/Paci fi c,  and  the Americas) and the INSARAG Secretariat (FCSS in OCHA-Geneva).

9.8.3 Regional Groups: To  facilitate  worldwide  participation,  INSARAG  is  organized  in  three regional  groups:  Africa  &amp;  Europe,  Asia  &amp;  Paci fi c  and  the  Americas. The  regional  groups  meet annually  to  exchange  information  and  experiences  acquired  in  previous  relief  operations, plan  SAR  training  and  discuss  methodology  for  cooperation  among  SAR  teams.  It  makes recommendations to the Steering Group for further improvement of international cooperation and coordination in disaster response.

9.8.4 Working Groups: INSARAG creates regional and international working groups on an 'as required' basis to develop solutions to problems that were identi fi ed in regional meetings. The working groups discontinue after delivering  the  requested  result.  All  member  countries  and organizations are encouraged to participate in INSARAG Working Groups.

9.8.5 INSARAGMembership: INSARAG is a network of stakeholders of international earthquake response. Any country or organization with international urban search and rescue response capacity or countries that are prone to earthquakes may join the network. India is a member of INSARAG Asia Paci fi c Regional Group and has been participating in the INSARAG meetings at international and regional levels. Instructors from India participate in the mock exercises organized by the INSARAG.

9.8.6 India was the Chairman of INSARAG Asia Paci fi c Regional Group in 2005-06 and organized the meeting as well as the UNDAC Refresher Course during this period of the chairmanship. The INSARAG Guidelines provide guidance for the preparation and deployment of search and rescue (SAR) teams for international disaster response operations to earthquake-prone countries as well as checklists for the minimum requirements of USAR teams envisaged for international response operations.  The  INSARAG  Guidelines de ne  coordination  and  cooperation  procedures fi for international and national responders in major disasters. The following phases are covered:

- · Preparedness
- · Activation
- · Operation
- · Reassignment/stand-down
- · Return to home base.

In  addition,  the  guidelines  focus  on  topics  of  particular  concern  to  any  organisation  that are  deployed  to  international  emergency  response  operations.  These  include  background information about the international humanitarian environment and an explanation of the role of the United Nations system (i.e. OCHA and other UN Humanitarian Agencies) as well as the concept for the On-Site Operations Coordination Centre (OSOCC).

9.8.7 USAR Exercises: Each  year,  INSARAG organises regional USAR simulation-exercises and awareness training courses. These events provide a platform to introduce and practice disaster response coordination methodology as de fi ned in the INSARAG Guidelines. The exercises and courses are typically hosted by earthquake-prone countries. The target audiences are national disaster managers, the UNDAC team, IHP Support Modules as well as domestic disaster response teams  and  international  USAR  teams. The  recent  INSARAG  Asia-Paci fi c  Earthquake  Response Exercise was held in Agra, India from 3-6 May, 2011.

## 9.9 Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR)

9.9.1  GFDRR  was  set  up  in  September  2006  jointly  by  the  World  Bank,  donor  partners  (21 countries  and  four  international  organisations),  and  key  stakeholders  of  the  International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN-ISDR). It is a long-term global partnership under the ISDR system established to develop and implement the HFA through a coordinated programme for reversing the trend in disaster losses by 2015. Its mission is to mainstream disaster reduction and climate change adaptation in a country's development strategies to reduce vulnerability to natural hazards. At the national and local levels, it also includes other sectoral development strategies  that  the  countries  most  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters  may  undertake  to  alleviate poverty and address sustainable growth.

9.9.2 GFDRR has three main business lines (Box 9.2) to achieve its development objectives at the global, regional and country levels.

## Box 9.2: Development Objective at Global, Regional and National Level

| Track-I   | Global and Regional Partnerships (to strengthen and re-organise ISDR processes    to  increase its outreach)                                                                 |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Track-II  | Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) in Development (bene fi ts low to medium  income countries; supports sectoral projects like health, education and research etc.) |
| Track-III | Standby Recovery Financing Facility (SRFF) for Accelerated Disaster Recovery (focuses in  low income countries).                                                             |

As  and  when  required,  India  has  been  participating  in  the  status  of  observer  in  the  GFDRR programme.

## 9.10 ASEAN Region Forum (ARF)

9.10.1 The ASEAN Regional Forum ( ARF) was established in 1994. The ARF membership including India, which joined in 1996 is 25 countries. The fi rst ARF meeting in 1994 brought together Foreign Ministers from Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, European Union (Presidency), Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, New Zealand, PNG, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, USA and Vietnam. The current Chairman of ARF is H. E. Pham Gia Khiem, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign A ff airs, Ministry Govt. of, Vietnam. ASEAN established the ARF Unit at the ASEAN Secretariat, Jakarta, Indonesia on 26 th June 2004.

## Disaster Management in India

9.10.2 Based on its Terms of Reference, the ARF Unit's role and functions are as follows:

- · To support the enhance role of the ARF Chair, including interaction with other regional and international organizations, defense o ffi cials dialogue and Track II organizations,
- · To function as depository of ARF documents/papers,
- · To manage database/registry,
- · To  provide  secretarial  works  and  administrative  support,  including  serving  as  the  ARF's institutional memory.

9.10.3 The ARF is the Principle Forum for Security Dialogue in Asia and complements the various bilateral alliances and dialogues, which underpin the region's security architecture. The ARF is premised on the idea drawn from the ASEAN experience that a process of dialogue can produce qualitative improvements in political relationships. It provides a platform for members to discuss current  regional  security  issues  and  develop  cooperative  measures  to  enhance  peace  and security in the region.

9.10.4 The ARF is characterised by consensus decision-making and minimal institutionalisation. The ARF concept paper set out a three-stage, evolutionary approach to the ARF's development, moving from con fi dence building to preventive diplomacy and, in the long term, towards a con fl ict resolution capability. While the ARF continues to focus on con fi dence building measures, ARF members have also agreed that preventive diplomacy should proceed in tandem with these e ff orts, particularly in areas of overlap between con fi dence building and preventive diplomacy. As all ASEAN members are automatically ARF members, India is actively participating in the ARF meetings and disaster relief exercises.

## 9.11 Asian Disaster Reduction Centre (ADRC)

9.11.1  A  resolution  was  adopted  at  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  in  1997  to  reduce damage  from  natural  disasters  substantially  by  designating  the  1990s  as  the  International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. Following a series of national conferences held during the period from 1994 to 1997 to discuss the cooperation for disaster reduction, a ministerial level conference was held in Kobe, Japan in 1995 in which 28 countries from Asia and other regions participated.  It  adopted  the  Kobe  declaration  which  includes  an  agreement  to  consider  the creation of a system which has the functions of a disaster reduction centre for the Asian region. The Asian Disaster Reduction Centre (ADRC) was thus established in Kobe in 1998 following an agreement among the participating countries with the Japanese government.

9.11.2 The mission of the ADRC is to enhance disaster resilience of the member countries, to build safe communities and to create a society where sustainable development is possible. The

## 9.15. India's engagement with external agencies on Disaster Risk Reduction

India is engaged with UNDP and US Aid for building the capacity of its response mechanism, mapping the vulnerabilities to di ff erent kind of disasters, besides strengthening the various institutions engaged in disaster management. It has entered in to MOU with the few countries in the fi eld of disaster management and has been working closely with the several countries in the exchange of ideas and expertise developed to meet the challenges of several natural disasters. The e ff orts undertaken towards the aforesaid activities are given in the subsequent Paras.

## 9.16. United Nations Development Programme

9.16.1 UNDP established on 22 nd November 1965 is the UN's global development network, with headquarters at New York to advocate for change and to connect countries through knowledge, experiences and resources to help people build a better life. In India, it works closely with the Government of India through its designated nodal department for di ff erent welfare programmes and the Department of Economic A ff airs (DEA) in the Ministry of Finance.

## Disaster Management in India

9.16.2 In the fi eld of disaster management, UNDP has been engaged with India since the Latur earthquake in 1993, followed by its involvement in the capacity development programme in 1996. In 1999, after the super cyclone in Orissa, it supported the community-based disaster risk management programme in 20 blocks in Orissa which ultimately led to the formulation and implementation of the Disaster Risk Management Programme aimed at building the community's resilience in disaster preparedness and mitigation measures. Under this programme, which was implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Home A ff airs, assistance to the tune of US $ 41 million was provided to the central government and 17 state governments for disaster risk reduction primarily at the community level in 176 multi hazard prone districts. It also had an urban earthquake vulnerability reduction component implemented in 38 cities during 20022009.

9.16.3 After the successful implementation of this DRM Programme,  the Government of India together with UNDP, has launched a new programme for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) with an outlay of $20 million (approximately ' 100 crores). At present the DRR Programme is being implemented  in  26  states  and  58  cities  across  the  country  under  the  overall  supervision  of Programme Management Board headed by Secretary (Border Management).

## 9.16.4 The GOI-UNDP DRR Programme (2009-2012) has two components:

- (i) Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)
- (ii) Urban Risk Reduction (URR).

9.16.5  DRR  project  is  being  implemented  by  NDMA  with  an  outlay  of  USD  12.6  million (approximately ' 63  crores)  and URR project is being implemented by Disaster Management Division, MHA with an outlay of USD 7.4 million ( ' 37 crores). The Joint Secretary, MHA is the National Programme Director for URR component. The Joint Secretary, NDMA is the National Programme Director for DRR component.

9.16.6 The objective and major activities undertaken in the programme are as follows:

Objective: To strengthen the institutional structure to undertake disaster risk reduction activities at various levels (state, district, city, urban local body) including risks being enhanced due to climate change, and develop preparedness for recovery.

## Major Activities:

- · Strengthening  the  State  and  District  Disaster  Management  Authorities  to  ful fi l their responsibilities as stipulated in the Disaster Management Act, 2005
- · Developing methodologies and modalities for ensuring risk reduction through integration in development programmes of all partners at national, state and community levels
- · Enhancing the capacity for urban risk reduction by addressing planning capacity building, and ensuring suitable legislative and regulatory mechanisms to promote safe built environment
- · To  strengthen  the  recovery  framework,  through  which  the  people  a ff ected  by  disasters (especially  the  most  vulnerable) are able to access resources for rebuilding their lives and reviving their livelihoods, and
- · To strengthen the knowledge and information sharing platform in disaster management.

## 9.17. Program for Enhancement of Emergency Response (PEER)

- 9.17.1  The  Program  for  Enhancement  of  Emergency  Response  (PEER)  is  a  regional  training programme initiated in 1998 by the United States Agency for International Development's, O ffi ce of U.S Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) to strengthen disaster response capacities in Asia. India, Indonesia, Combodia, Vieteman, Loa PDR Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh are the participating countries under the programme. PEER is a fi ve years training programme started in March 2009, funded by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and identi fi ed outside the Disaster Management Support Project Grant.

## 9.17.2 Programme Objectives: Following have been the objectives of the programme

- i. Community Action for Disaster Response (CADRE): This training program targets local, non-professional  emergency  responders,  drawing  upon  PEER  core  trainings,  i.e.  Medical First Responder (MFR) and Collapsed Structure Search and Rescue (CSSR) Courses.
- Country  coverage: Bangladesh,  Cambodia,  India,  Indonesia,  Lao  PDR,  Nepal,  Pakistan, Philippines and Vietnam.
- ii. Hospital  Preparedness  for  Emergencies  (HOPE): Designed  for  health-care  personnel, both administrative and medical, to prepare health-care facilities and personnel to respond e ff ectively  to  emergencies  involving  large  numbers  of  casualties. The  course  will  enable hospitals/health facilities to develop well-designed, facility-speci fi c  disaster preparedness plans  to  increase  their  ability  to  respond  to  emergencies  and  continue  functioning  to provide critical medical care.
- Country coverage: Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Nepal, Pakistan,Philippines and Vietnam.
- iii. Medical  First  Responder  (MFR)  and  Collapsed  Structure  Search  and  Rescue  (CSSR) Course: The main goal under this objective is   to establish and strengthen the capability of PEER Countries to provide collapsed structure search and rescue; and basic and advanced life, Support  during  emergencies  by  further  strengthening  and  institutionalizing  the Medical First Responder (MFR) and Collapsed Structure Search and Rescue (CSSR) courses. MFR Course provides individuals the knowledge and skills necessary to assess, treat and transport sick or injured patient, as a result of an emergency or disaster, thus training them for 'First Response Task' . CSSR Course provides individuals with collapsed structure rescue tasks the knowledge and skills necessary to search for, stabilize and extricate victims trapped in collapsed structures using the safest and most appropriate procedures, thus training them for 'Collapsed structure rescue task.'

Country coverage: Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and   Philippines.

## 9.22. Asian Minister Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR)

9.22.1 Following the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in 2005, several initiatives were undertaken  to  strengthen  the  ISDR  system  to  be  able  to  better  respond  to  current  disaster trends and the increased expectations and demands by nations and communities for supporting implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 (HFA).

9.22.2 This has resulted in increased political commitment and fi nancing of disaster reduction, including  development  sectors.  At  the  global  level  more  coherence  and  better  coordination amongst ISDR system partners has been achieved through joint work planning and prioritized deliverables.  A  common approach to work programming in the ISDR system was developed during the 2006-2007 biennium in the context of the former Inter-Agency Task Force on Disaster Reduction and presented to the fi rst session of the Global Platform.

9.22.3 Those consultations gave rise to an ISDR system joint planning framework for country, regional and global levels based on the priorities for action of the Hyogo Framework. To monitor and share the country's progress at a regional platform, AMCDRR was conceptualized. Since then four such conferences were held to enhance and promote regional cooperation for seamless implementation of HFA.

- a. The 1 st AMCDRR was held in China in August 2005 known as Beijing resolution with the strategic objective of enhancing regional cooperation in the implementation of HFA in Asian region and disaster management cooperation between governments.
- b. The 2 nd AMCDRR was hosted by India in November 2007 at New Delhi with the strategic objective  of  construction  of  joint  response  system  through  cooperation  among  each governments, regional cooperative bodies UN and international organizations.
- c. The  3 rd AMCDRR  was  held  in  December  2008-  known  at  Kaulalampur,  Malasiya,  which focused on cooperative system through 'mutual assistance with private sector' between various parties concerned in the Asian and Paci fi c region.
- d. The 4 th AMCDRR was held at Inchon, South Korea during October 2010 known as Incheon declaration focused on three main themes as mentioned below:
-  Raising awareness and building capacity for DRR &amp; CCA
-  Developing and Sharing information, technology, sound practices and  lessons learned in climate and disaster risk management.
-  Promoting integration of DRR &amp; CCA into development for green growth.

## 9.23. Conclusion

This chapter has attempted to capture the various international cooperation initiatives. While India does not seek assistance during the relief and response phases, it welcomes sharing of expertise  and  also  technical  assistance  based  on  various  international  developments.  As  a signatory to the Hyogo Framework of Action, India is also committed to achieve the priorities and the objectives through systematic and institutional e ff orts.

## 10.1 Background

In the last decade there has been a paradigm shift in Disaster Management in India, a distinct move from the earlier approach of post disaster relief to pre-disaster preparedness, mitigation and risk reduction. The 10th Five Year Plan document emphasised that  ' while hazards, both natural or otherwise, are inevitable, the disasters that follow need not be so and the society can be prepared to cope with them e ff ectively whenever they occur ' and called for a ' multi-pronged strategy for total risk management, comprising prevention, preparedness, response and recovery, on the one hand, and for initiating development e ff orts aimed towards risk reduction and mitigation, on the other' . It is stated that only then we can look forward to 'sustainable development.' The country is  also committed  to mainstream disaster risk reduction into the process of development  planning at all levels for sustainable development, as stated in Hyogo Framework of Action 2005-15: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters .

## 10.2 Recent Initiatives

The  11th fi ve  year  plan  document  of  Government  of  India  gave  impetus  to  mainstreaming disaster risk reduction as one of the priority programmes in the development planning process and disaster management. 'Building Back Better' has become the underlining principle in any post  disaster  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  programme  implemented  by  Government  of India. As mentioned in the report of the working group on Disaster  Management for the 11 th plan  and also in the various initiatives towards this e ff ort, the way forward can be divided in the following  major areas -

- · Policy  guidelines  at  the  macro  level  that  would  inform  and  guide  the  preparation  and implementation of disaster management and development plans across sectors,
- · Building in a culture of preparedness and mitigation,
- · Operational guidelines of integrating disaster management practices into development, and speci fi c developmental schemes for prevention and mitigation of disasters,
- · Having robust early warning systems coupled with e ff ective response plans at district, state and national levels.
- · Building capacity of all stakeholders,
- · Involving the community, NGOs, CSOs and the media at all stages of DM,
- · Addressing gender issues in disaster management planning and developing a strategy for inclusive approach addressing the disadvantaged sections of the society towards disaster risk reduction, and
- · Addressing climate risk management through adaptation and mitigation.

## 10.3 Suggested Steps

To  achieve  results  in  these  key  identi fi ed  areas,  the  following  suggested  steps  should  be integral to all stages of DM including developing a culture of prevention by introducing disaster management in school curricula , professional courses and enhancing the capacity of disaster managers by strengthening training facilities for disaster management; creating mass awareness by disseminating knowledge about the hazards and risks and promoting coping capacities of the communities through community based disaster risk management for better preparedness

## Disaster Management in India

and response; fostering social and gender equality in disaster risk reduction by  planning and focusing on the needs of the disadvantaged sections of the society.  The summarised list of actions that needs to be taken is as follows:

## 10.4 Developing a Centralised Database

In collaboration with the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) an integrated Centralised Disaster database  requires  to  be  developed.  Data  collection  on  standardised  format  should  be  the responsibility of the concerned state government. Such database would facilitate researchers and decision makers to undertake range of analyses to better understand the linkages between disaster management and other sectors that would help in taking up informed risk reduction activities as well as to understand the impact of disasters on economy.

## 10.5 Early Warning Systems and Communication and Connectivity upto the Last Mile

Early warning systems vary for the di ff erent types of disasters. Due to recent unprecedented devastation unleashed by tsunami, often early warning gets linked with tsunami only, masking the importance of early warning against other forms of disasters. Hazard- speci fi c  e ffi cient 'early warning systems' is the need of the hour and it has to be put in place permanently, so that useful information fl ows throughout the year and is  easily  understood by the local community. There  is  scope  for  improvement  in fl ood,  cyclone  and  storm  surge  warnings.  Such  projects need further encouragement and newer projects should be accorded high priority. Even with the best of early warning systems, the impact may still be catastrophic if early warning signals are not properly interpreted and communities are not educated and trained to respond to the early warning signals in real time. Therefore, the technology to early warning, on the one hand and, community response to early warning to the other are urgently required. This needs to be coupled with the National Emergency Communication Plan to ensure real time dissemination of early warnings and information to the 'at risk' community and the local authorities.

## 10.6 Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs)

EOCs in the country could play a critical role in coordinating emergency activities as well as in providing information to various stakeholders.  E ff ective functioning of these EOCs during emergencies continues to be a major challenge.  'State of the art' EOCs at state and district levels with access to satellite based imageries need to be planned and established.

## 10.7 Mitigation Plans and Mainstreaming  Disaster Management  into  the Development Planning Process

10.7.1 Three committees constituted by Government of India are working towards preparing the  National  Response  Plan,  National  Human  Resource  and  Capacity  Development  Plan  and National Mitigation Plan in respective ministries that have been designated as nodal agencies for various disasters. The draft National Response Plan and National Human Resource and Capacity Development Plan are ready.  Certain recti fi cations and modi fi cations are underway before it is presented to the National Executive Committee for its fi nalisation.

10.7.2  It  is  expected  that  National  Response  Plan  will  be  put  in  place  once  it  is  adopted  by Government of India.  It will pave the way for institutionalising the response plan in three tiers as envisaged in the Disaster Management Act.

10.7.3 Similarly, the Capacity Development Plan, once it is approved and adopted will provide the roadmap for undertaking the capacity building of persons engaged in di ff erent facets of disaster management and enhancing the capacities both at the individual and organizational levels.

10.7.4 So far, Ministries of Defence, Mines (Geological Survey of India), Department of Atomic Energy, Department of Agriculture &amp; Cooperation, Railways and Water resources have submitted their  mitigation  plans  which  are  under  examination  and fi nalisation.    Once  these  mitigation plans are approved, the concerned Ministries will undertake the recommended prevention and mitigation measures to address the hazards and risks involved in the core activities of their sector. It is the endeavor of the Government to persuade the other ministries to bring their mitigation plans at the draft stage and take it further for its approval and adoption.

10.7.5 Working Group on Disaster Management: Planning Commission, GOI, has constituted a working Group on Disaster Management for providing inputs to the 12 th  Five year Plan (20122017) vide no. M-12016/03/2011-PAMD. The Terms of Reference (speci fi c to working group) were as under;

- a. To recommend  measures  to  streamline existing institutional structure on disaster management in order to avoid multiplicity of structures keeping in view the provision of the Disaster Management Act 2005.
- b. To review implementation of disaster management policy towards disaster risk reduction, preparedness and mitigation at Centre and State levels and in the private sector.
- c. To explore innovative ways and means for applicable of Science &amp; Technology in disaster risk reduction.
- d. To  draw  a  roadmap  and  policy  framework  to  encourage  public-private  partnership  and community participation in disaster management.
- e. To assess integration of disaster management related concerned to be inbuilt central sector and centrally sponsored schemes/projects.
- f. To suggest programmes for capacity building for disaster mitigation at Centre, State and district levels with special reference to rural and urban area.
- g. To  indentify  priority  areas  and  projects  along  with fi nancial  resources  to  be  undertaken through NDMA. Central Ministries and State Govts in integrated manner during the 12 th Plan period

## 10.8 Strengthening the Preparedness Phase

Some  of  the  illustrative  areas  and  activities  that  would  reduce  the  risk  from  hazards  in  the preparedness phase   are summarised as follows-

10.8.1 Urban  Planning  and  Zoning: There  is  a  need  to  enhance  the  e ff orts  for  integrating disaster risk reduction elements in settlement planning and land use zoning to mitigate fl ood and earthquake risks. This issue had been mentioned repeatedly at di ff erent for a by administrators, practitioners and NGOs working in the area of disaster management. Human settlements must be viewed not only from the perspective of their vulnerability, but also from the perspective of the disasters that they create or that they exacerbate. There is an urgent need to examine such settlements  being  developed  by  private  builders  and  developers,  which  could  increase fl ood

## Disaster Management in India

vulnerability in urban and rural areas of many states. Planned urban settlements and housing is the need of the day for disaster risk management that leads to sustainable development, particularly in ecologically sensitive regions, high risk locations and high population density pockets.

10.8.2 Building Codes and Enforcement :  Building  codes  are  adhered to only in engineered structures and not in the huge majority of houses across rural and urban India. The building codes have to be continually upgraded with the advent of  new information and technology. The greatest challenge, however, is in respect to enforcement of the building codes.

10.8.3 Housing Design and Finance: It  has  been  di ffi cult  to  ensure  compliance  to  disaster resistant technology at individual house level. There is need  to fi nd alternative ways to encourage and facilitate individual home builders to use disaster-resilient designs, materials and techniques in  the  construction  of  their  homes.  Publicity  and  audience  friendly  information  emphasising appropriate designs and the cost di ff erences will go a long way in creating awareness among people for their adoption. Some fi nancial incentives or tool may  motivate people, particularly poor people or fi rst-time house owners, to incorporate safety features in their houses.

10.8.4 Flood Proo fi ng: This is  an  approach adopted in parts of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and few other fl ood prone states of the country for reducing fl ood vulnerability.   Flood proo fi ng involves constructing earthen mounds to raise entire homesteads-the house, the vegetable garden, livestock pen, grain stores, toilets and water wells above the fl ood level. Encouraging such good practices in other fl ood prone parts of the country, would go a long way to reduce the risk in such area.

10.8.5 Promoting development of new fi nancial tools: There is needto work for development of new fi nancial tools such as catastrophic risk fi nancing, risk insurance, catastrophic bonds, microfi nance etc. Risk transfer and risk insurance mechanisms would be needed for infrastructure, crops and other assets.  Making risk insurance mandatory at least in highly hazard prone states in the country needs to be encouraged. Insurance distributes disaster risk among the broader society and makes great sense when risk has been reduced to some acceptable level.

10.8.6 Agriculture and Aquaculture : These projects should be assessed from the perspective of the fl ood hazards. Much of the fl ooding that a ff ects large rural habitats and agricultural lands is because of reduced drainage as a result of the expansion of agricultural activities into wetland areas  that  previously  served  an  important  drainage  function.    Mainstreaming  disaster  risk management such development  of agriculture practices should have compensatory drainage factored into agricultural expansion plans.

10.8.7 Roads and Infrastructure: Standards are generally set to protect roads, railways, power and communication infrastructure from being damaged or destroyed by a 10 or 20 or 50 year fl ood level. Any new infrastructure project should conduct a disaster impact analysis and ensure that construction does not impede water fl ow and cause deeper or prolonged fl oods. Designing the roads to the higher standards requires factoring of not only the vulnerability of the roads to fl oods but also their contribution to hazard.

10.8.8 Logging activities: These activities in the hilly areas destabilise slopes, cause landslides and increase mud fl ow and silting in the nearby rivers. The revenue generated by logging is far lesser than the losses incurred due to the serious problems of landslides, silting and ecological disturbance caused. There should be a plan for a ff orestation in the logging area before or just after the logging.

## Box  10.1: Risk Transfer mechanisms-Insurance as a fi nancial tool for Disaster Management

For decades, the fi nancing of disasters has relied on a reactive approach consisting of the diversion of funds from the domestic budgets. Such 'ex post' funding approaches are ine ffi cient,  often poorly  targeted  and  insu ffi cient.  Moreover,  they  provide  no  incentive  for  proactive  risk reduction measures such as improved urban planning, higher construction standards, etc.

Reactive approaches to risk fi nancing are becoming increasingly unsustainable as vulnerability is increasing and emerging economies grow and accumulate more assets. The funding gaps between  available  donor  resources  and  post-disaster  funding  will  grow  if  disaster  prone countries do not engage in risk reduction and pre-disaster risk fi nancing.

Insurance markets in the majority of developing countries are underdeveloped. Where hazard coverage exists, it is usually limited to major industrial and commercial properties and some wealthier households.

For a number of years, e ff orts are on to promote a more proactive approach to risk fi nancing. A number of examples come from World Bank led e ff orts, including the provisions of technical support to Mexico in issuing a cat bond; contingency fi nancing arrangements in Cambodia, the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facilities (CCRIF -  the fi rst regional institution which allows the eighteen participating countries to pool their risk and save on individual premium payments), the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP - a mandatory earthquake insurance pool  for  homeowners). These  initiatives  provide  much  needed,  immediate  liquidity  after  a disaster for more e ff ective government response.

Micro disaster Insurance: It has great potential, but faces several challenges before it becomes a sustainable mechanism for e ff ective risk management for the poor. The study by ProVention Consortium  and  the  International  Institute  of  Applied  System  Analysis  found  that  micro Insurance holds great potential to protect the poor from disaster shocks.

Financial Viability: Disaster Insurance should be based on sound estimates of low-probability, high-consequence risks so that the premium can be priced and the requisite capital reserve or reinsurance can be assured. Where there is a high degree of ambiguity with the risk estimates of extreme events, international donors may need to provide incentives for the private sector involvement in such schemes.

A ff ordability: Micro  insurance  needs  to  be  a ff ordable  to  low  income-clients.  Disaster  insurance premiums  include  the  costs  of  handling  many  small  contracts,  distributing  the  product  often  to remote areas, as well as assuring su ffi cient capital to cover dependant claims. There are several ways to  reduce  disaster  insurance  premiums. The  most  obvious  is  subsidies  from  the  public  authorities, international donors or those at lower risk in the insurance pool (cross subsidies in insurance systems). The Hungarian government is providing subsidies to poor households as part of a recently legislated fl ood insurance pool. In the UK, extensive cross subsidies in the private fl ood insurance systems make it a ff ordable to low income households. In developing countries, transaction costs can be minimised by o ff ering policies to groups or communities through established micro fi nance institutes. The high costs of capital reserves and reinsurance can be lowered through government or donor provision of reinsurance. An example is the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool, where the World Bank reinsures a layer of risk for the pool.

## Disaster Management in India

10.8.9 Design and construction of critical infrastructure and lifeline facilities (hospitals/ schools etc): It  has  been  observed in the past disasters that schools and hospitals are badly a ff ected. Therefore, construction of all new schools and hospital needs to be brought under the regime of disaster resistant technology.

10.8.10  Medical  Preparedness  for  recovery  of  a ff ected  person  in  any  kind  of  disaster  is  of paramount importance. There exits huge gap between demand and supply of medical care, particularly in the area of trauma care. This needs to be strengthened and capacity augmented at every level from primary to referral level. The capacity of doctors and Paramedical sta ff also needs to be strengthened and to be geared to meet the challenges of post-disaster recovery.

## 10.9 Capacity Building Plan

In addition to development of National Human Resource Plan, a training calendar of Disaster Management institutes and agencies at the international, national and sub-national levels needs to be compiled and publicised so that the stakeholders could avail of the opportunities to build capacities.

10.9.1 Concerted e ff orts are required to  work closely with UN agencies, bilateral agencies and NGOs for DRR.  Bilateral and Multilateral Cooperation with countries prone to hazard and those having developed expertise in management of di ff erent disasters and  international institutions for DRR would facilitate  and  encourage participation of professionals and o ffi cials in national and international events in enhancing their capacities.

10.9.2 International collaboration in the fi eld of disaster management should be strengthened. The NDMA and NIDM have to play a key role in awareness generation and engage with print, electronic and folk media to carry forward programmes for public awareness. There is also a great need to develop the capacity and sensitise the media to comprehend disaster awareness and reporting,  so that it plays a positive role in creating awareness and in handling disaster information and news during emergencies.

10.9.3  In  order  to  address  the  issue  of  structural  safety  against  multi-hazards,  steps  that lead  to  improvement  of  construction  on  the  ground  need  to  be  initiated. This  would  entail enhancing community awareness, capacity building of architects and masons, strengthening of enforcement, etc.

10.9.4 Inter-state sharing of resources has been very e ff ective in the past. Such sharing should be facilitated by encouraging states to enter into mutual agreements with each other on possible nature  and  type  of  resources  that  can  be  shared  and  set  up  administrative  mechanisms  for implementing these e ff ectively.

## 10.10  National, State and District Level Response Plans

The recent Japanese earthquake, tsunami, followed by fi re  and  the  nuclear  energy  crisis  is  a pointer to the fact that despite best preparedness and mitigation and capacity building plans being in place, response and crisis management plans continue to be relevant. To put things in place an e ff ective response plans at the National, States, Districts and the Sub-districts level should  therefore,  be  encouraged  to  strengthen  review  and  update  the  existing  capacity  for response and crisis management.

## 10.11 Corporate Social Responsibility

Business entities are expected to shoulder responsibilities for the impact of their activities on the consumers, employees and community as a whole. E ff orts are therefore needed to engage corporate bodies in undertaking disaster risk reduction activities as a part of their corporate social responsibilities. NDMA and NIDM have to actively engage with the corporate sector in mainstreaming DRR within their CSR framework.

## 10.12 Integrating Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction

The current trends of climate change are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of existing hazards, an increased probability of extreme events, spur the emergence of new hazards and vulnerabilities with di ff erential spatial and socio-economic impacts. This is likely to further degrade the resilience and coping capacities of poor and vulnerable communities, who make up  from  a  quarter  to  half  of  the  population  of  most  Indian  cities  Vulnerability  has  typically contributed  more  to  overall  risk  in  India  than  hazard  exposure.  The  e ff orts  for  integrating climate change and DRR measures needs to be further strengthened and institutionalised and community be sensitised to take up such adaptive measures, which reduces their vulnerability.

## 10.13 Conclusion

The  above  mentioned  initiatives  are  only  an  indicative  list  of  actions  requiring  attention. Every stakeholder involved needs to contribute his bit in order to ensure that the increasing hazards and risks and the vulnerabilities get addressed in a planned and systematic manner, thereby increasing the coping capacities of the communities at large and making them resilient to  the  impacts  of  disasters.  The  Government  is  committed  to  structure  and  convert  these requirements into actionable format to place them on a roadmap and source the funding for their implementation.
