# To-Do List (Without Storage)

## Concept
A basic to-do list where users can add and remove tasks.

## Skills Reinforced
- **Adding and removing HTML elements dynamically**: Interact with the DOM to manipulate list items.
- **Using event delegation**: Handle events efficiently on multiple elements with a single handler.
- **CSS styling for hover effects**: Enhance user experience with visual cues.

## Features
- Input field for tasks.
- A button to add tasks to the list.
- Click on a task to remove it.

## Example Steps
1. Create an input field and a button.
2. When the button is clicked, add the task to an unordered list (`<ul>`).
3. Clicking on a task removes it from the list.

## IMPORTANT: Create the Javascript (script.js) which corresponds to the html and css files.
