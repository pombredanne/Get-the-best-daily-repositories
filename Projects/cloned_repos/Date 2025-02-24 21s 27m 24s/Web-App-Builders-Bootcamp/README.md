## Bootcamp Overview

This bootcamp will have you building from Week 1, and by Week 22 you will be building and deploying a full‑stack web app on AWS. The frontend and backend remain separate until Weeks 11 and 12, when you will build your first few full‑stack apps. The goal is to help you gain confidence in web app development by working on practical projects. While this bootcamp won’t cover every detail, it provides a clear roadmap for learning the essentials to start building your own powerful applications.

This free and open‑source resource was created to give back to the community—something I wish had been available when I began my own journey in tech.

## Intro and Foreword

Hello!

This is a “junior” full‑stack developer bootcamp curated using free and open‑source resources. Realistically, you might be hard pressed to find an actual “junior full‑stack developer” role—but they do exist. Given the current job market, economic climate in North America, and broader tech landscape, full‑stack development roles are likely to increase due to factors such as AI, funding, and evolving market forces.

Having been laid off in 2022 and needing to rebuild my career, I learned that change is constant. While roles may shift or disappear, the ability to build applications remains an invaluable skill. This bootcamp is a call to action: view yourself as a builder, ready to adapt and create impactful applications.

Before we dive in, consider the debate around AI’s role in development. For further reading on AI and its current limitations:
- [Apple Research on GSM-Symbolic](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/gsm-symbolic)
- [Reuters: OpenAI’s Limitations](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-rivals-seek-new-path-smarter-ai-current-methods-hit-limitations-2024-11-11/)
- [YouTube: New Research On CoPilot and Code Quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et8CqMu_e6s&ab_channel=ThePrimeTime)

Even if tech jobs are offshored, your skills as a developer remain valuable. Keep building, stay adaptable, and remember: having something built is always better than having nothing built.

## About the Bootcamp

[Bootcamp Pipeline Explanation Video - How to do the bootcamp!](https://youtu.be/zaLfGx6YLvM)




While I organized the learning pipeline, the real credit goes to the creators of the resources linked throughout this bootcamp. I encourage you to explore their channels and social media!

This bootcamp is divided into three distinct sections:
- **Frontend**
- **Backend**
- **Intro to Programming**

These sections eventually converge when we begin building full‑stack applications, highlighting the unique intricacies of each area.

Instead of working on guided projects, the initial projects within this bootcamp will push you to work on projects on your own in an "explorative" way. This is to reinforce the topics you are learning from each video within the first few weeks.

Eventually, during the harder projects, you will be presented with guided projects and have a chance to work on your own app to reinforce your learning.

**Important Notes:**
- Complete each lesson sequentially (e.g., Week 1 of Frontend, Backend, and Intro to Programming should be done concurrently).
- There WILL be times where you may not know what to do during explorative projects, just remember that times like these will happen during the job and not just in this bootcamp. Force yourself to figure it out on your own. This is a skill that you will hone during the next few months, and will take you far afterwards.
- Mastery comes with practice, time, and experience—exposure alone is not enough.
- After finishing the bootcamp, continue building and honing your skills with your own projects!
