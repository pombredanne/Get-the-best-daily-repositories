- When I mentioned “Ready to release”, I meant:
  - Retrieve the codebase, updating the [README.md](mdc:README.md), and then rewriting the [README.zh-CN.md](mdc:README.zh-CN.md) based on the updated README.
- When I mentioned “Hi”，I meant：
  - Deeply retrieve the codebase, prompting me to optimize the specific section.
  - If there is a bug, please mark it specifically.
  - Do not start directly; let me choose the task.
