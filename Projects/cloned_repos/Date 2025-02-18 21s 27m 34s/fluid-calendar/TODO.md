# FluidCalendar Implementation Plan

## Next Steps
- [ ] Integrate google calendar
  - [ ] auto sync with webhooks
  - [ ] when deleting one event  from the series, it deletes all instances locally but google is working fine.
- [ ] prevent adding events to read-only calendars
- [ ] allow changing calendar color
- [ ] allow calendar re-ordering in the UI
- [ ] when deleting a recurring event, it deletes all instances but it shows a random instance which disappears after a sync, also i tried it again and it only deleted the instance locally but the entire series deleted from google.
- [ ] add ability to RSVP
- [ ] show events not RSVPed to
- [ ] show spinner when deleting/creating/updating in event modal
- [ ] get rid of the master event concept.
- [ ] Use AI to break down tasks
