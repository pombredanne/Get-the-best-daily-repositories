## Google Cloud Setup

To enable Google Calendar integration, you'll need to set up a Google Cloud Project:

1. Create a Project:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Click "New Project" and follow the prompts
   - Note your Project ID

2. Enable Required APIs:
   - In your project, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for and enable:
     - Google Calendar API
     - Google People API (for user profile information)

3. Configure OAuth Consent Screen:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
   - Choose "External" user type
   - Fill in the required information:
     - App name: "FluidCalendar" (or your preferred name)
     - User support email
     - Developer contact information
   - Add scopes:
     - `./auth/calendar.events`
     - `./auth/calendar.readonly`
     - `./auth/userinfo.email`
     - `./auth/userinfo.profile`
   - Add test users if in testing mode

4. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Choose "Web application"
   - Set Authorized JavaScript origins:
     - `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
     - Your production URL (if deployed)
   - Set Authorized redirect URIs:
     - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` (for development)
     - `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google` (for production)
   - Click "Create"
   - Save the generated Client ID and Client Secret

5. Update Environment Variables:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
   ```

Note: For production deployment, you'll need to:
- Verify your domain ownership
- Submit your application for verification if you plan to have more than 100 users
- Add your production domain to the authorized origins and redirect URIs

## Installation

### Option 1: Docker Image (Recommended)

The easiest way to run FluidCalendar is using our official Docker image:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull eibrahim/fluid-calendar:latest

# Create data directory for persistent storage
mkdir -p data

# Create a .env file
cat > .env << EOL
DATABASE_URL=file:/app/data/dev.db
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
EOL

# Stop and remove existing container if it exists
docker stop fluid-calendar || true
docker rm fluid-calendar || true

# Run database migrations
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  --env-file .env \
  eibrahim/fluid-calendar:latest \
  npx prisma migrate deploy

# Run the application
docker run -d \
  --name fluid-calendar \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  --env-file .env \
  eibrahim/fluid-calendar:latest

# View logs (optional)
docker logs -f fluid-calendar
```

After starting the container, visit http://localhost:3000/settings and configure your Google credentials and logging preferences in the System Settings tab.

#### Useful Docker Commands:
```bash
# Stop the container
docker stop fluid-calendar

# Start an existing container
docker start fluid-calendar

# Remove the container
docker rm fluid-calendar

# View logs
docker logs -f fluid-calendar

# Check container status
docker ps -a | grep fluid-calendar

# Reset database (if needed)
rm -rf data/* && docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  --env-file .env \
  eibrahim/fluid-calendar:latest \
  npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Available tags:
- `latest` - Latest stable release
- `dev` - Development version
- `v*.*.*` - Specific versions (e.g., v1.0.0)

For production deployments, we recommend using specific version tags.

### Option 2: Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fluid-calendar.git
cd fluid-calendar
```

2. Setup the project (installs dependencies and sets up database):
```bash
npm run setup
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Useful Local Development Commands:
```bash
# Start Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npm run prisma:studio

# Generate Prisma client
npm run prisma:generate

# Run database migrations
npm run prisma:migrate

# Clean the project (remove node_modules and .next)
npm run clean
```

### Option 3: Docker Development

We provide a Docker setup for easy development. This is the recommended way to get started.

1. Prerequisites:
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
   - Git for cloning the repository

2. Clone and start the application:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fluid-calendar.git
cd fluid-calendar

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start the application with hot reloading
npm run docker:dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

#### Docker Development Features:
- 🔄 Hot reloading enabled
- 💾 Persistent database storage
- 🛠️ Automatic Prisma migrations
- 🔒 Secure default configuration

#### Useful Docker Commands:
```bash
# Start the application
npm run docker:dev

# Rebuild and start
npm run docker:dev:build

# Stop the application
npm run docker:dev:down

# View logs
npm run docker:logs

# Clean up volumes and containers
npm run docker:clean
```

## Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure the following environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your database connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your application URL
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Random string for session encryption

3. Optional environment variables (can be configured in System Settings instead):
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: From Google Cloud Console
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: From Google Cloud Console
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (none/debug)

Note: Google credentials and logging settings can be managed through the UI in Settings > System. Environment variables will be used as fallback if system settings are not configured.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
