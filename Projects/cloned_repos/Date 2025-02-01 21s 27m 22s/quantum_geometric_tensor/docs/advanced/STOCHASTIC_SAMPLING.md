# Stochastic Sampling with Diffusion Models and PINNs

This document describes the implementation of stochastic sampling using diffusion models and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in the quantum geometric learning framework.

## Theory

### Diffusion Models

The diffusion process is defined by a forward stochastic differential equation (SDE):

```
dx = f(x,t)dt + g(t)dW
```

where:
- `f(x,t)` is the drift term
- `g(t)` is the diffusion coefficient
- `dW` is a Wiener process

The reverse process for sampling follows:

```
dx = [f(x,t) - g(t)²∇log p(x,t)]dt + g(t)dW
```

where `p(x,t)` is the probability density at time t.

### Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

The PINN approach uses neural networks to solve the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) that describes the evolution of the probability density:

```
∂p/∂t = -∇·(fp) + (1/2)∇·(g²∇p)
```

The neural network is trained to minimize the residual of this equation using collocation points.

## Implementation Details

### Neural Network Architecture

The implementation uses a fully connected neural network with:
- Input layer: state dimension + time
- Hidden layers with GELU activation
- Output layer: scalar log density

### Training Process

1. Collocation points are generated using Langevin Monte Carlo to sample from high-density regions
2. The network is trained to minimize the FPE residual:
   ```
   R = ∂log p/∂t - (1/2)g² * (∇²log p + |∇log p|²)
   ```
3. Spatial derivatives are computed using finite differences
4. Time derivatives use forward differences

### Sampling Algorithm

1. Initialize samples from standard Gaussian
2. Solve reverse SDE using Euler-Maruyama scheme:
   ```
   x_{t+1} = x_t + [f(x_t,t) + g(t)²s_θ(x_t,t)]Δt + g(t)√Δt ε
   ```
   where:
   - s_θ is the score estimate from the neural network
   - ε is standard Gaussian noise

## Usage

### Configuration

Three main configuration structures:

1. `DiffusionConfig`: Controls the diffusion process
   - Time range (t_min, t_max)
   - Number of discretization steps
   - Noise schedule parameters

2. `PINNConfig`: Neural network parameters
   - Architecture (layers, dimensions)
   - Training hyperparameters

3. `LMCConfig`: Langevin Monte Carlo settings
   - Step size and number of steps
   - Number of parallel chains

### Example Usage

```c
// Configure diffusion process
DiffusionConfig diffusion_config = {
    .t_min = 0.001,
    .t_max = 0.999,
    .num_steps = 100,
    .beta_min = 0.1,
    .beta_max = 20.0,
    .use_cosine_schedule = true
};

// Configure PINN
PINNConfig pinn_config = {
    .input_dim = 2,
    .hidden_dim = 128,
    .num_layers = 4,
    .learning_rate = 0.001,
    .batch_size = 128,
    .max_epochs = 1000,
    .weight_decay = 0.0001
};

// Create and initialize sampler
StochasticSampler* sampler = stochastic_sampler_create(
    &diffusion_config,
    &pinn_config,
    &lmc_config
);

// Train the model
stochastic_sampler_train(sampler);

// Generate samples
double* samples = malloc(num_samples * dim * sizeof(double));
stochastic_sampler_sample(sampler, num_samples, samples);
```

## Performance Considerations

1. Memory Management
   - Efficient allocation and reuse of temporary buffers
   - Careful management of neural network parameters

2. Numerical Stability
   - Use of stable finite difference schemes
   - Careful handling of time discretization

3. Parallelization Opportunities
   - Batch processing of samples
   - Parallel chain updates in LMC
   - GPU acceleration potential for neural network operations
