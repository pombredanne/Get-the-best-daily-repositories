# These are the target performance metrics

# Run available benchmarks
cd benchmarks
./run_benchmarks.sh --quantum

# Target metrics:

# - Resource utilization: 90% optimal (In development)
```

## Development Troubleshooting

### Current Limitations

1. Compilation Issues
```bash
# Common compilation errors:
# - Hardware integration modules not yet complete
# - Some dependencies may be missing or incompatible
# - Test suite may fail due to incomplete features

# For development assistance:
# - Check GitHub issues for known problems
# - Join the developer mailing list
# - Review the development roadmap
```

2. Hardware Integration
```bash
# Note: Hardware backends are not yet functional
# Development status:
# - IBM Quantum: Integration in progress
# - Rigetti: Planning phase
# - D-Wave: Planning phase
```

3. Performance Optimization
```bash
# Performance monitoring tools are under development
# Current focus areas:
# - Core algorithm optimization
# - Memory management
# - Hardware acceleration
```
