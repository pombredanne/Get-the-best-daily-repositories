# Surface Code Implementations

This document describes the different surface code implementations available in the quantum geometric learning library and their characteristics.

## Overview

Surface codes are a family of quantum error correction codes that are particularly promising for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our library implements several variants, each with its own advantages and trade-offs:

1. Standard Surface Code
2. Rotated Surface Code
3. Heavy Hex Surface Code
4. Floquet Surface Code

## Implementation Details

### Standard Surface Code

The standard surface code implementation uses a regular 2D lattice arrangement with:
- Data qubits at the vertices
- X-type stabilizers (star operators) around vertices
- Z-type stabilizers (plaquette operators) on faces

**Advantages:**
- Simple, regular structure
- Well-understood error correction properties
- Straightforward implementation and measurement
- Good balance of X and Z error protection

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires more physical qubits compared to rotated variant
- Higher connectivity requirements
- May be challenging to implement on near-term hardware

### Rotated Surface Code

The rotated surface code uses a modified lattice arrangement that:
- Reduces the number of physical qubits needed
- Maintains the same distance as the standard code
- Uses a different arrangement of stabilizer measurements

**Advantages:**
- Requires fewer physical qubits (~50% reduction)
- More efficient use of resources
- Better suited for near-term hardware
- Maintains error correction capabilities

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex stabilizer patterns
- May require more sophisticated control sequences
- Slightly more challenging to implement measurement circuits

### Heavy Hex Surface Code

The heavy hex surface code is specifically designed for superconducting qubit architectures:
- Uses a modified hexagonal lattice
- Reduces connectivity requirements
- Optimized for realistic hardware constraints

**Advantages:**
- Better suited for superconducting quantum processors
- Reduced connectivity requirements
- More hardware-efficient implementation
- Compatible with IBM Quantum hardware

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly lower error threshold
- More complex boundary conditions
- May require more sophisticated decoding

### Floquet Surface Code

The Floquet surface code implements a time-dependent variant that:
- Uses periodic driving to implement stabilizer measurements
- Allows for continuous error correction
- Provides protection against time-dependent noise

**Advantages:**
- Natural protection against time-dependent errors
- Continuous operation without discrete measurement cycles
- Potential for higher thresholds in certain noise models
- More robust against certain types of coherent errors

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex control requirements
- Requires precise timing control
- More sensitive to calibration errors
- Higher classical processing overhead

## Performance Characteristics

Our benchmark suite (`benchmarks/benchmark_surface_codes.c`) evaluates several key metrics:

1. **Initialization Time:**
   - Time required to set up the code structure
   - Memory allocation and configuration
   - Initial state preparation

2. **Stabilizer Operations:**
   - Time to perform complete rounds of stabilizer measurements
   - Scaling with code distance
   - Memory access patterns and cache efficiency

3. **Cleanup/Reset:**
   - Resource deallocation efficiency
   - System state restoration
   - Memory management overhead

## Usage Guidelines
