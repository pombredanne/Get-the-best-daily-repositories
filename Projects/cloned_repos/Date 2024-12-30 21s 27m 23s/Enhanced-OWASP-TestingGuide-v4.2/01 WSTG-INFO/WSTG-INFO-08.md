# WSTG-INFO-08: Fingerprint Web Application Framework

## Objective
To identify the web application framework used by the target application, which can provide insights into its potential vulnerabilities and configuration issues.

## Key Steps

### 1. Inspect HTTP Headers
Analyze HTTP response headers for framework-specific identifiers.
- Headers to look for:
  - `X-Powered-By`
  - `Server`
- Example:
  ```
  X-Powered-By: Express
  Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
  ```

### 2. Examine HTML Source Code
Search the HTML source code for:
- Comments indicating the framework.
- Framework-specific meta tags or IDs.
- Example:
  ```html
  <!-- Generated by Django -->
  <meta name="generator" content="Joomla! 3.9">
  ```

### 3. Analyze JavaScript Files
Review linked JavaScript files for framework-specific patterns.
- Look for libraries or frameworks such as Angular, React, or Vue.js.
- Tools:
  - Browser developer tools to inspect loaded scripts.

### 4. Use Automated Tools
Employ tools to identify the framework automatically.
- Tools:
  - [WhatWeb](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb):
    ```bash
    whatweb http://targetdomain.com
    ```
  - [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/)

### 5. Check for Default Pages and URLs
Locate default pages or URLs that may indicate the framework.
- Examples:
  - `/wp-admin` (WordPress)
  - `/index.php` (PHP-based frameworks)

### 6. Inspect Framework-Specific Resources
Search for framework-specific resources such as:
- Static files with framework-specific structures.
- CSS or JavaScript files named after the framework.
- Example:
  ```
  /static/admin/css/base.css (Django)
  ```

### 7. Analyze Network Requests
Use browser developer tools to capture network requests and analyze them for framework-specific indicators.
- Check for:
  - Specific API endpoints.
  - Patterns in URLs.

### 8. Document Findings
Log the identified framework(s) with the following details:
- Framework name and version (if available).
- Evidence supporting the identification.
- Potential vulnerabilities or risks associated with the framework.

## Tools and Resources
- **Browser Tools**:
  - Developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools).
- **Tools**:
  - WhatWeb
  - Wappalyzer
  - BuiltWith
- **Online Services**:
  - [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/)
  - [Netcraft](https://www.netcraft.com/)

## Mitigation Recommendations
- Ensure the framework and its dependencies are up to date.
- Remove or obfuscate framework-specific identifiers where possible.
- Regularly audit the application for vulnerabilities specific to the identified framework.
