# WSTG-BUSL-03: Testing for Business Logic Data Validation

## Summary

Business logic vulnerabilities related to data validation occur when an application fails to enforce proper validation of user inputs, leading to unintended behaviors or security risks. Properly implemented validation ensures that user inputs are consistent with the intended logic and design of the application.

## Objective

To identify and exploit weaknesses in business logic where the application fails to validate or sanitize user inputs properly, leading to vulnerabilities such as:

- Circumvention of expected workflows
- Data integrity issues
- Unauthorized actions or data access

## How to Test

### Step 1: Understand the Business Logic
1. Review the applicationâ€™s documentation or analyze the application to understand:
   - The expected workflows
   - Data validation rules
   - Input constraints

2. Identify areas where user input plays a critical role in the application's functionality, such as:
   - Form submissions
   - API endpoints
   - Data processing mechanisms

---

### Step 2: Analyze Inputs and Expected Behavior
1. Identify all inputs and determine their expected behavior (e.g., data type, format, constraints).
2. Consider how data is stored, processed, and validated.

---

### Step 3: Test for Validation Weaknesses
Perform the following tests:

1. **Boundary Value Analysis**:
   - Submit inputs at the edge of allowed ranges to determine if validation is properly enforced.
   - Example: If a field accepts integers between 1 and 100, try 0, 101, or non-integer values.

2. **Injection of Invalid Data**:
   - Submit data outside the expected type or format.
   - Example: Submit text to numeric fields or inject special characters.

3. **Testing with Empty or Null Values**:
   - Submit empty or null values to check if the application handles them correctly.

4. **Invalid State Transitions**:
   - Manipulate workflows by submitting inconsistent or unexpected data.
   - Example: Skip steps in a multi-step form or modify the sequence of actions.

5. **Mass Assignment and Over-Posting**:
   - Send additional fields in requests to modify data not intended to be controlled by the user.

---

### Step 4: Exploit Identified Weaknesses
1. If validation is absent or improperly implemented, attempt to exploit the behavior.
2. Document potential impacts, such as:
   - Data corruption
   - Unauthorized actions
   - Circumvention of business rules

## Tools

- Proxy tools (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) for intercepting and modifying requests
- Custom scripts or automated fuzzers to test inputs systematically

## Remediation

1. Implement robust server-side validation for all user inputs, ensuring:
   - Validation of data types, formats, and constraints
   - Rejection of invalid or malformed inputs
   - Application of appropriate sanitization techniques

2. Use centralized validation libraries or frameworks to ensure consistency.

3. Perform regular reviews and updates of validation logic as business requirements evolve.

4. Implement secure coding practices and perform regular security testing.
