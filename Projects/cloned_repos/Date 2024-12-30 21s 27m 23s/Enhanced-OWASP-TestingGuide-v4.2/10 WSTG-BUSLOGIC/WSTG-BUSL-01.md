# WSTG-BUSL-01: Test for Business Logic Data Validation

## Summary

Testing for business logic data validation ensures that the application enforces the correct rules, processes, and constraints for user input and operations. Weaknesses in business logic validation can lead to unintended behaviors, bypassing of security controls, or data manipulation.

## Objectives

1. Identify areas where business logic validation is applied.
2. Ensure proper validation of user input and operations.
3. Validate adherence to business rules and constraints.

## How to Test

### 1. Understand Business Logic

- Review the applicationâ€™s documentation, workflows, and expected behavior.
- Identify key business logic rules and constraints, such as:
  - Input requirements (e.g., data types, ranges).
  - Operational constraints (e.g., role-based permissions, transaction limits).
  - Process flows (e.g., sequential steps, dependencies).

### 2. Identify Data Validation Points

- Locate areas where user input affects business logic, such as:
  - Form submissions
  - API endpoints
  - Transaction processes

### 3. Test Input Validation

- Provide various input types to test validation mechanisms:
  - Valid and invalid data
  - Edge cases (e.g., maximum/minimum values, special characters)
  - Malformed input (e.g., SQL injection, XSS payloads)
- Observe application behavior and error handling.

#### Tools:
- Burp Suite
- Postman
- Fiddler
- Custom scripts

### 4. Test Logical Constraints

- Verify adherence to business rules:
  - Ensure role-based permissions are enforced (e.g., users cannot access admin functionality).
  - Test transaction limits (e.g., maximum purchase quantity).
  - Validate sequence enforcement (e.g., step 1 must precede step 2).
- Manipulate input data to bypass constraints and observe results.

### 5. Analyze Error Handling

- Check how the application handles invalid operations:
  - Ensure meaningful and user-friendly error messages are displayed.
  - Verify that sensitive information is not exposed in error responses.

### 6. Test for Workflow Bypasses

- Attempt to bypass expected workflows:
  - Skip steps in multi-step processes.
  - Repeat or manipulate operations to test idempotency.
  - Exploit concurrency issues (e.g., race conditions).

#### Tools:
- Browser developer tools
- Automated testing tools (e.g., Selenium)

## Remediation

1. Implement Proper Input Validation:
   - Validate all user inputs against expected data types, ranges, and formats.
   - Use allowlists wherever possible.
2. Enforce Business Rules:
   - Apply constraints consistently across all relevant workflows.
   - Perform server-side validation in addition to client-side validation.
3. Secure Error Handling:
   - Ensure error messages do not expose sensitive information.
   - Provide clear and consistent feedback to users.
4. Conduct Regular Reviews:
   - Periodically review business logic for vulnerabilities.
   - Test workflows against updated requirements.
