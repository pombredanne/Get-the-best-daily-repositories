# WSTG-BUSL-08: Testing for Trust Boundaries Violation

## Summary

Trust boundary violations occur when an application improperly handles interactions between different trust levels, such as between users, roles, or systems. These vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or exposure of sensitive data.

## Objective

To identify and exploit scenarios where trust boundaries are violated, allowing an attacker to:

- Access unauthorized data or functionalities
- Perform actions outside their assigned trust level
- Escalate privileges or compromise other trust zones

## How to Test

### Step 1: Identify Trust Boundaries
1. Map out trust boundaries within the application, including:
   - User roles (e.g., admin vs. regular user)
   - Authentication states (e.g., authenticated vs. unauthenticated)
   - Interactions between different systems or subsystems

2. Determine where trust is granted or enforced, such as:
   - Access control checks
   - Role-based permissions
   - API interactions with third-party systems

---

### Step 2: Analyze Potential Violations
Focus on areas where trust boundaries might be violated, such as:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Test if lower-privileged roles can access higher-privileged functionalities.

2. **Data Ownership**:
   - Verify if users can access or manipulate data they do not own.

3. **Cross-Trust Interactions**:
   - Assess if unauthorized data or commands can be injected between trust boundaries.

4. **Third-Party Integrations**:
   - Check if external systems can exploit weak trust boundaries to gain access.

---

### Step 3: Perform Trust Boundary Tests
1. **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**:
   - Test if a user can access data or functionalities of other users at the same privilege level.
   - Example: Modify a `user_id` parameter to access another user's account.

2. **Vertical Privilege Escalation**:
   - Test if a lower-privileged user can perform actions reserved for higher-privileged roles.
   - Example: Attempt to access admin-only features via API or direct URLs.

3. **Cross-System Interactions**:
   - Test if interactions between different systems or modules respect trust boundaries.
   - Example: Manipulate a request from one module to access another module's restricted resources.

4. **Injection Attacks**:
   - Test if inputs from lower-trust zones affect higher-trust zones.
   - Example: Submit malicious inputs in a user form to affect admin functionality.

5. **Testing Authentication Gaps**:
   - Verify if unauthenticated users can perform actions meant for authenticated users.
   - Example: Access restricted endpoints without authentication.

---

### Step 4: Analyze Results
1. Document scenarios where trust boundaries were improperly enforced.
2. Assess the potential impact, such as:
   - Unauthorized access to sensitive data
   - Compromise of system integrity
   - Escalation of privileges

## Tools

- **Proxy Tools** (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) for intercepting and modifying requests
- **Automated Testing Tools** (e.g., Postman, Fiddler) for testing API interactions
- **Role-Specific Testing Accounts** to test interactions between different roles
- **Custom Scripts** (e.g., Python with `requests` library) to simulate attacks

---

## Remediation

1. **Implement Strict Access Controls**:
   - Enforce role-based and data-based access controls consistently.
   - Ensure that each action is verified against the user's trust level.

2. **Validate Inputs Across Boundaries**:
   - Sanitize and validate all inputs crossing trust boundaries.

3. **Secure Inter-System Communications**:
   - Use authentication, encryption, and validation for communications between systems.

4. **Monitor and Log Boundary Violations**:
   - Detect and respond to attempts to cross trust boundaries.

5. **Conduct Regular Security Testing**:
   - Perform penetration tests and code reviews to identify and mitigate trust boundary violations.
