# WSTG-BUSL-09: Testing for Weaknesses in Business Logic Security Controls

## Summary

Business logic security controls ensure that an application enforces its intended rules and prevents unauthorized or malicious actions. Weaknesses in these controls can lead to exploitation of vulnerabilities, resulting in bypassing critical processes, data manipulation, or privilege escalation.

## Objective

To identify weaknesses in the enforcement of business logic security controls, focusing on scenarios where attackers can:

- Circumvent security restrictions
- Exploit gaps in validation or enforcement
- Manipulate application behavior in unintended ways

## How to Test

### Step 1: Understand the Application's Security Controls
1. Identify key security controls within the business logic, such as:
   - Role-based access controls (RBAC)
   - Validation of inputs and workflows
   - Dependencies between processes

2. Determine how these controls are implemented and enforced:
   - Server-side vs. client-side enforcement
   - Reliance on hidden or exposed parameters
   - Use of tokens, session states, or other mechanisms

---

### Step 2: Analyze Potential Weaknesses
Focus on areas where controls may be weak or missing, such as:

1. **Role Validation**:
   - Verify if actions or data access are restricted to specific roles.

2. **State Integrity**:
   - Test if workflows enforce valid states throughout a process.

3. **Input and Parameter Validation**:
   - Analyze how inputs are validated and whether they are protected from tampering.

4. **Session and Token Management**:
   - Assess if session states and tokens are securely managed and validated.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Look for error messages that expose sensitive information or enable bypassing controls.

---

### Step 3: Perform Security Control Tests
1. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Test if lower-privileged users can access higher-privileged functionalities.
   - Example: Modify API requests to execute admin-only operations.

2. **Workflow Tampering**:
   - Manipulate workflows to bypass validation steps.
   - Example: Skip payment verification steps in a purchase process.

3. **Parameter Tampering**:
   - Modify hidden or exposed parameters to bypass restrictions.
   - Example: Change a `role` parameter from `user` to `admin`.

4. **Session Hijacking or Replay**:
   - Attempt to reuse session tokens or manipulate cookies to gain unauthorized access.

5. **Error-Based Bypass**:
   - Exploit error handling to bypass security controls.
   - Example: Trigger a validation error to reveal sensitive data or alternate paths.

---

### Step 4: Analyze Results
1. Identify and document weaknesses in security controls, including:
   - Insufficient enforcement of access controls
   - Workflow inconsistencies
   - Vulnerabilities in parameter or input validation

2. Assess the potential impact, such as:
   - Unauthorized access to sensitive data
   - Financial loss due to payment or transaction bypass
   - Privilege escalation

---

## Tools

- **Proxy Tools** (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) for intercepting and manipulating requests
- **Automation Tools** (e.g., Postman, Fiddler) for systematic testing of controls
- **Custom Scripts** (e.g., Python or Bash scripts) for tampering with inputs, tokens, or sessions
- **Role-Specific Testing Accounts** to simulate various levels of privilege

---

## Remediation

1. **Strengthen Access Controls**:
   - Implement strict role-based access controls (RBAC) at the server level.
   - Validate all user actions against their roles and permissions.

2. **Validate Inputs and Parameters**:
   - Perform robust validation on all inputs and parameters, rejecting unexpected or tampered data.

3. **Secure Workflow Integrity**:
   - Enforce state transitions to ensure workflows follow the intended sequence.

4. **Protect Sessions and Tokens**:
   - Use secure session management practices, including token expiration and replay protection.

5. **Log and Monitor Control Violations**:
   - Record attempts to bypass security controls and alert administrators.

6. **Regularly Test Business Logic Security**:
   - Conduct periodic assessments to identify and address gaps in security controls.
