# WSTG-BUSL-07: Testing for Misuse of Functionality

## Summary

Misuse of functionality vulnerabilities occur when legitimate application features can be abused to perform unintended or malicious actions. This can include using functionalities in unexpected ways or chaining them together to bypass restrictions, manipulate data, or cause a denial of service.

## Objective

To identify and exploit instances where application functionalities can be misused, leading to:

- Bypassing security controls
- Data manipulation or exfiltration
- Resource exhaustion
- Unintended exposure of sensitive data

## How to Test

### Step 1: Identify Critical Functionalities
1. Review application features and functionalities, such as:
   - File uploads and downloads
   - Search and filtering options
   - Email or messaging systems
   - APIs for automation

2. Prioritize functionalities that:
   - Interact with sensitive data
   - Perform critical operations (e.g., financial transactions)
   - Are accessible to unauthenticated or low-privilege users

---

### Step 2: Analyze Functionality for Misuse
Evaluate how each functionality could be used in unintended ways. Examples include:

1. **Input Overload**:
   - Sending large or excessive data to overwhelm resources.
   - Example: Flooding a search feature with wildcards to cause a denial of service.

2. **Chaining Functionalities**:
   - Combining multiple features to bypass security measures.
   - Example: Using file upload and a poorly secured preview feature to execute malicious code.

3. **Parameter Manipulation**:
   - Altering parameters to retrieve unauthorized data.
   - Example: Modifying a `user_id` parameter in an API to access another user's data.

4. **Abuse of Automation APIs**:
   - Exploiting APIs to automate unintended actions.
   - Example: Using an API to repeatedly reset a userâ€™s password.

5. **Unauthorized Data Extraction**:
   - Using legitimate features to extract sensitive data.
   - Example: Exploiting search or export functionalities to enumerate database entries.

---

### Step 3: Perform Misuse Tests
1. **Test for Abuse of Input Parameters**:
   - Submit unexpected or excessive input to functionalities.
   - Example: Injecting SQL queries into search parameters.

2. **Manipulate Workflow**:
   - Use legitimate functions in an unexpected sequence.
   - Example: Upload a file, then attempt to access it directly without authentication.

3. **Automate and Scale Actions**:
   - Use tools to automate legitimate functions at scale to assess impact.
   - Example: Sending repeated account recovery requests to a target user.

4. **Combine Features**:
   - Chain unrelated features to perform unintended actions.
   - Example: Upload a file to a shared folder and use a public link to expose it.

---

### Step 4: Analyze Results
1. Document any instances where functionalities were misused successfully.
2. Assess the impact of misuse, such as:
   - Security bypass
   - Data leakage or corruption
   - Resource exhaustion
   - Financial or reputational damage

---

## Tools

- **Proxy Tools** (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) for intercepting and modifying requests
- **Automation Tools** (e.g., Postman, Python scripts) to scale and automate legitimate actions
- **Fuzzing Tools** for testing excessive input or parameter tampering

---

## Remediation

1. **Implement Rate Limiting**:
   - Restrict the frequency and volume of actions to prevent abuse.

2. **Enforce Access Controls**:
   - Validate user permissions for every action and feature.

3. **Secure Input Validation**:
   - Validate and sanitize inputs for all functionalities to prevent injection attacks.

4. **Monitor and Log Usage**:
   - Detect and respond to unusual patterns of functionality usage.

5. **Regularly Test for Misuse**:
   - Conduct regular assessments to identify potential abuse scenarios.
