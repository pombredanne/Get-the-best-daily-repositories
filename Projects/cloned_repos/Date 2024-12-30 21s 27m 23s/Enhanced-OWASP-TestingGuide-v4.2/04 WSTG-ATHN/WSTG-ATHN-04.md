# OWASP WSTG v4.0 - WSTG-ATHN-04

## Test Name: Testing for Bypassing Authentication Schema

### Overview
This test aims to identify weaknesses in the authentication schema that may allow attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.

---

### Objectives
- Detect vulnerabilities that enable authentication bypass.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the authentication mechanisms in place.
- Identify misconfigurations or flaws in authentication workflows.

---

### Test Steps

#### 1. **Test for Direct Page Access**
   - **Scenario**: Check if restricted pages can be accessed without authentication.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Identify URLs or endpoints that require authentication.
     2. Attempt to access them directly without logging in.
   - **Indicators**:
     - Successful access to restricted pages or functionality.
     - No redirection to the login page.

#### 2. **Test for Parameter Modification**
   - **Scenario**: Attempt to bypass authentication by modifying parameters.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Intercept requests using tools like Burp Suite.
     2. Modify parameters like `user_id`, `session_token`, or `role`.
   - **Indicators**:
     - Access granted after modifying parameters.
     - Authentication checks skipped based on tampered parameters.

#### 3. **Inspect Authentication Tokens and Cookies**
   - **Scenario**: Test for flaws in token-based authentication mechanisms.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Capture authentication tokens or cookies.
     2. Analyze their structure and attempt to forge or reuse them.
   - **Indicators**:
     - Predictable or easily forgeable tokens.
     - No expiration or revocation of reused tokens.

#### 4. **Test Alternate Authentication Mechanisms**
   - **Scenario**: Evaluate if alternate authentication methods bypass primary checks.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Test login methods like SSO, OAuth, or social login integrations.
     2. Verify if alternate methods grant access to unauthorized accounts.
   - **Indicators**:
     - Inconsistent checks across different authentication methods.
     - Weak validation in alternate authentication workflows.

#### 5. **Test for Brute Force Vulnerabilities**
   - **Scenario**: Determine if authentication can be bypassed through brute force.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Use automated tools to test multiple credential combinations.
     2. Observe system responses for clues or access.
   - **Indicators**:
     - Lack of rate limiting or CAPTCHA mechanisms.
     - Responses indicate valid usernames or credentials.

#### 6. **Inspect Server-Side Authentication Logic**
   - **Scenario**: Check for logic flaws in server-side authentication checks.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Review server responses to authentication-related requests.
     2. Test unusual inputs or sequences (e.g., null values, injection payloads).
   - **Indicators**:
     - Authentication bypass using malformed or unexpected input.

---

### Tools
- **Burp Suite**: Intercept and modify authentication requests.
- **Postman**: Test and analyze API endpoints.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Scan for authentication vulnerabilities.
- **Hydra or Medusa**: Automate brute force attacks.
- **JWT.io**: Analyze and modify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

---

### Remediation
- Enforce strict access controls and redirect unauthorized requests to the login page.
- Use strong, unpredictable tokens and cookies with proper expiration and revocation mechanisms.
- Implement rate limiting, account lockout, and CAPTCHA to prevent brute force attacks.
- Regularly audit authentication workflows, including alternate methods like SSO or OAuth.
- Validate all user inputs server-side to prevent bypass using tampered parameters.

### Checklist
- [ ] Restricted pages are inaccessible without authentication.
- [ ] Tokens and cookies are secure and tamper-proof.
- [ ] Alternate authentication methods undergo consistent validation.
- [ ] Brute force protections, such as rate limiting, are implemented.
- [ ] Authentication logic is robust and prevents bypass through manipulation or injection.
