# Installation
*(You can always put this Readme File into ChatGPT & ask for a Detailed Step-by-Step Installation Tutorial From Scratch if you're new to installing bots.)*

## 1. Prerequisites

1. Wallet: A Solana-compatible wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) with SOL, USDC, or WSOL.


2. Node.js: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

   
3. Solana CLI: Command-line interface for interacting with the Solana blockchain.


4. Selenium WebDriver (Chrome): Automated web browser.


5. SOL Balance: The ratio I suggest is 1:10, that is, for every 1 SOL you'll use per trade, have 10 SOL in the wallet (so if you're using 0.1 SOL per trade, have 1 SOL in wallet. Just make sure you have more SOL for Faster Snipes)
