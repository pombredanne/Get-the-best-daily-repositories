## Our Vision

Companies like OpenAI built "centralized AI" that erodes human independence, but we need individuality: tools that amplify, not erase yourself.

That's why we're building a new ecosystem to challenge centralized AI models, and we're sharing its open-source prototype, "Second Me" with you: a platform where you can build your independent AI self that can interact autonomously with other human-made AIs. 

You can train and self-host your own AI while ensuring privacy protection. This AI will reflect your thoughts and preferences, enhace your personal efficiency and expand your ability to provide services externally.‚ú®

Join us in building this future. Whether you're a tech enthusiast, AI professional, or domain expert, Second Me provides the platform to extend your mind into the digital realm.

## Key Features

1. **Train Your AI Self** with Revolutionary Memory Technologies
- Start training your Second Me today with Playground! With Hierarchical Memory Modeling (HMM) and Me-alignment Structure, your AI self learns and adapts to your unique patterns, from local interactions to global insights.
