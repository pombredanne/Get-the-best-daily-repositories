## VEKOS Key Features

- **Verified Operations**: Every filesystem and memory operation is cryptographically verified using a proof system
- **Secure Memory Management**: Buddy allocator with memory zones and COW (Copy-On-Write) support
- **Modern Shell**: Basic shell implementation with command history and line editing
- **Filesystem**: Verified filesystem (VKFS) with Merkle tree verification
- **Process Management**: Basic process management with scheduling and signals
- **Hardware Support**: x86_64 architecture support with proper GDT, IDT, and interrupt handling

## Current Functionality

- **Memory Management**
  - Buddy allocation system
  - Page table management
  - Memory zones (DMA, Normal, HighMem)
  - Copy-on-Write support
  - Memory pressure handling

- **Filesystem**
  - Basic filesystem operations (create, read, write, delete)
  - Directory support
  - Verification using Merkle trees
  - Buffer cache system
  - Inode management

- **Process Management**
  - Basic process creation and management
  - Simple scheduler
  - Signal handling
  - Process groups and sessions

- **Shell**
  - Command history
  - Line editing
  - Basic built-in commands (cd, ls, pwd, help, clear)
  - Command parsing with quote handling

- **Security Features**
  - Operation verification through cryptographic proofs
  - State transition validation
  - Memory isolation
  - Privilege levels

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Rust nightly toolchain
- `cargo-xbuild` for cross-compilation
- QEMU for testing (optional)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/JGiraldo29/vekos.git
cd vekos

# Build the kernel
cargo build

# Run in QEMU (if installed)
cargo run
```

2. Create a feature branch
3. Write clean, documented code
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Submit a pull request

## Known Limitations

As this is an alpha release (0.0.1), there are several limitations:

- Limited hardware support
- Basic device driver support
- Experimental verification system
- Limited filesystem features
- Basic shell functionality
- Unsecure code

## Future Plans

- Extended hardware support
- Network stack implementation
- Enhanced security features
- GUI support
- Extended system calls
- Improved documentation
