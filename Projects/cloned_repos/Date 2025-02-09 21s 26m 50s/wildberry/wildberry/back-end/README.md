# Express.js TypeScript Server

This document is aimed at developers contributing to or maintaining the server setup for handling product and customer interactions.

## Project Overview

This project sets up a backend server using **Express.js** with **TypeScript**, focusing on product management, customer data, and purchase handling. It's designed with simplicity in mind for educational purposes but includes comments and notes for production considerations.

## Technical Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest LTS version)
- TypeScript (latest stable version)

### Installation

To get started:

1. **Clone the repository** or create the necessary structure.

2. **Install dependencies**:

   npm install


## TypeScript Configuration:

Ensure you have a tsconfig.json file with settings like:
json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}

## Development

Compiling TypeScript:
bash
npm run build  # or yarn build if using Yarn
Running the Server:
bash
npm start  # or node dist/index.js

This starts the server on localhost:3000 or whatever port is specified.

## API Endpoints

Here's a brief overview of the implemented endpoints:

GET /offerings - Returns offering data (currently stubbed).
GET /products - Fetches products by IDs provided in query parameters.
POST /purchase - Handles purchase logic (simplified; no real payment).
POST /restore - Placeholder for restoring purchases.
GET /customer/:appUserID - Retrieves basic customer info.

## Data Models

Product: 
id: string
name: string
description: string
price: number
currencyCode: string
Customer: 
id: string
email?: string | null
displayName?: string | null
PurchaseResult: 
productId: string
customerInfo: Customer

## In-Memory Data Store

Note: This is for demonstration. Use a real database for production.

## Development Notes

TypeScript: All code should be written in TypeScript for type safety. 
Middleware: body-parser is used, but consider moving to express.json() for simplicity in newer projects.
Error Handling: Basic error responses are implemented. Consider expanding this in production.
Security: 
Authentication: None implemented. You'll need to add JWT or session management for secure routes.
Data Validation: Basic checks are in place, but use a schema validator like joi for robust checks.
CORS: Not configured; add if necessary for cross-origin resource sharing.

## Contributing

Code Style: Follow TypeScript best practices and use ESLint for code linting.
Commit Messages: Use conventional commit messages for clarity in version control history.
Testing: No tests are implemented. Add unit and integration tests using frameworks like Jest or Mocha.

## Production Considerations

Database Integration: Replace in-memory data with a database connection (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
Environment Variables: Use .env files or similar for configuration.
Logging: Implement proper logging solutions for better debugging and monitoring.
Deployment: Consider containerization with Docker for consistency across environments.
