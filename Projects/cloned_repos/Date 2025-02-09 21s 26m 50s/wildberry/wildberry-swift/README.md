<h3 align="center">😻 In-App Subscriptions Made Easy 😻</h3>


wildberry is a powerful, reliable, and free to use in-app purchase server with cross-platform support. Our open-source framework provides a backend and a wrapper around StoreKit and Google Play Billing to make implementing in-app purchases and subscriptions easy. 

Whether you are building a new app or already have millions of customers, you can use wildberry to:

  * Fetch products, make purchases, and check subscription status with our [native SDKs](https://docs.wildberry.com/docs/installation). 
  * Host and [configure products](https://docs.wildberry.com/docs/entitlements) remotely from our dashboard. 
  * Analyze the most important metrics for your app business [in one place](https://docs.wildberry.com/docs/charts).
  * See customer transaction histories, chart lifetime value, and [grant promotional subscriptions](https://www.wildberry.com/docs/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-history/promotionals).
  * Get notified of real-time events through [webhooks](https://docs.wildberry.com/docs/webhooks).
  * Send enriched purchase events to analytics and attribution tools with our easy integrations.
