# ML Pipeline Template

This repository provides a Python script to set up a standard directory structure for machine learning projects. It helps you organize files and directories into a structured format that is ideal for developing, testing, and deploying ML models.

## Files

- `script.py`: A Python script to create a structured directory for an ML pipeline project.
- `Image.png`: An image showing the directory structure created by the script.

## Features

- **Automatic Directory Creation:** Creates essential directories for data, notebooks, source code, configuration, and more.
- **Placeholder Files:** Generates placeholder files with sample content to help you get started quickly.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madhanl6/ML-Template.git
   cd ML-Template
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Make sure Python is installed. Run the script with:


   ```bash
   python script.py <base_directory>
   ```

   - Replace `<base_directory>` with the desired path where the standard directory structure should be created. For example


   ```bash
   python script.py D:/Template
   ```

   - This above script will create the standard directory structure in the `D:/Template` directory. Adjust the path as needed based on your system and preferences.

## Customization

The file `script.py` can be further modified to fit specific needs. For example, we might want to add more directories, change the placeholder content, or adjust the default structure according to the project requirements.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or additional features, please open an issue or submit a pull request. This updated README provides a comprehensive overview of the changes made to the project structure and how to use the script effectively. Feel free to modify any sections further to better suit your project needs!
