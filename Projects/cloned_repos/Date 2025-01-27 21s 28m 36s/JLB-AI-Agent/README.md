## Examples

### LangGraph Multi-Agent System

The repository includes an advanced example of building a multi-agent system using LangGraph and JLB AI Agent. Located in `examples/agent-kit-langgraph`, this example demonstrates:

- Multi-agent architecture using LangGraph's StateGraph
- Specialized agents for different tasks:
  - General purpose agent for basic queries
  - Transfer/Swap agent for transaction operations
  - Read agent for blockchain data queries
  - Manager agent for routing and orchestration
- Fully typed TypeScript implementation
- Environment-based configuration

Check out the [LangGraph example](examples/agent-kit-langgraph) for a complete implementation of an advanced Solana agents system.
