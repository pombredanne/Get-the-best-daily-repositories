# MonST3R: A Simple Approach for Estimating Geometry in the Presence of Motion

**MonST3R**  processes a dynamic video to produce a time-varying dynamic point cloud, along with per-frame camera poses and intrinsics, in a predominantly **feed-forward** manner. This representation then enables the efficient computation of downstream tasks, such as video depth estimation and dynamic/static scene segmentation.

This repository is the official implementation of the paper:

## TODO
- [x] Release model weights on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z1jO_JmfZj0z3bgMvCwqfUhyZ1bIbc9E/view?usp=sharing)
- [ ] Release inference code for global optimization (est. time: 10/21)
- [ ] Release 4D visualization code (est. time: 10/21)
- [ ] Release evaluation code (est. time: 10/21)
- [ ] Release training code & dataset preparation (est. time: 10/21)

## Getting Started

We currently provide fine-tuned model weights for MonST3R, which can be downloaded on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z1jO_JmfZj0z3bgMvCwqfUhyZ1bIbc9E/view?usp=sharing).


The model weights can already be applied for **Two-View input** using DUSt3R's inference code. To test the model, follow the instructions below:

1. Install DUSt3R by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/naver/dust3r?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
2. Run `python3 demo.py --weights path/to/MonST3R_PO-TA-S-W_ViTLarge_BaseDecoder_512_dpt.pth`.

We will soon release the code for global optimization, 4D visualization, evaluation, and dataset preparation.
