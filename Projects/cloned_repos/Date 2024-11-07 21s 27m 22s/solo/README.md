## About 

Solo for Laravel is a package to run multiple commands at once, to aid in local development. After installing, you can open the SoloServiceProvider to add or remove commands.

You can have all the commands needed to run your application behind a single command: 

> php artisan solo

Each command runs in its own tab in Solo.

This would not be possible without Joe Tannenbaum's [Laracasts course](https://laracasts.com/series/cli-experiments), his [Chewie package](https://github.com/joetannenbaum/chewie), and of course [Laravel Prompts](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/prompts).

## Installation

Require the package:

```shell
composer require aaronfrancis/solo --dev
```

Install the Service Provider:
```shell
php artisan solo:install
```

## Usage

You can run Solo with the following command:

```shell
php artisan solo
```

This will start every command defined in your `SoloServiceProvider`.


## Customization

To customize Solo, you can open your `SoloServiceProvider` and make changes there.

By default, it will look something like this:

```php
namespace App\Providers;

use AaronFrancis\Solo\Commands\EnhancedTailCommand;
use AaronFrancis\Solo\Facades\Solo;
use AaronFrancis\Solo\Providers\SoloApplicationServiceProvider;

class SoloServiceProvider extends SoloApplicationServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        Solo::useTheme('dark')
            // Commands that auto start.
            ->addCommands([
                EnhancedTailCommand::make('Logs', 'tail -f -n 100 ' . storage_path('logs/laravel.log')),
                'Vite' => 'npm run dev',
                // 'HTTP' => 'php artisan serve',
                'About' => 'php artisan solo:about'
            ])
            // Not auto-started
            ->addLazyCommands([
                'Queue' => 'php artisan queue:listen --tries=1',
                // 'Reverb' => 'php artisan reverb:start',
                // 'Pint' => 'pint --ansi',
            ])
            // FQCNs of trusted classes that can add commands.
            ->allowCommandsAddedFrom([
                //
            ]);
    }

    public function boot()
    {
        //
    }
}
```

Several commands are provided to get you started in the right direction.

## Adding / removing commands

To add new commands, you can pass a key/value pair of name/command to `addCommands` or `addLazyCommands`.

Lazy commands do not auto start. That can be helpful when you don't need to run a command everytime, but it might be useful from time to time. Like Queues or Reverb.

You may also pass a `AaronFrancis\Solo\Commands\Command` instance (with no key) to the `addCommands` or `addLazyCommands` methods.

For example, notice the `EnhancedTailCommand` command here:

```php
Solo::useTheme('dark')
    // Commands that auto start.
    ->addCommands([
        EnhancedTailCommand::make('Logs', 'tail -f -n 100 ' . storage_path('logs/laravel.log')),
        'Vite' => 'npm run dev',
        // 'HTTP' => 'php artisan serve',
        'About' => 'php artisan solo:about'
    ])
```

`EnhancedTailCommand` is a subclass of `Command` with a little bit of logic to make the logs more readable. You're free to create your own subclasses if you want!

To remove a command, simply delete the command. No need to create a PR to fix the stub. We've provided a reasonable set of starting commands, but the `SoloServiceProvider` lives in your application, so you have full control of it.

## Usage

To use Solo, you simply need to run `php artisan solo`.

You'll be presented with a dashboard. To navigate between processes use the left/right arrows. You can scroll the output by using the up/down keys. **Shift + up/down** scrolls by 10 lines instead of one.

See the hotkeys on the dashboard for further details.

## Theming

Two themes are shipped by default: light and dark.

To change the theme you can pass 'light' or 'dark' to the `useTheme` method.

```php
Solo::useTheme('dark');
```

If you prefer to have it .env driven so that you and your teammates can have different themes, you can create a `config/solo.php` with a `theme` key. Manually set configuration takes precedence over configuration, so you'll need to remove the `useTheme` call.

### Creating a new theme

You can create a new theme by either subclassing the `LightTheme` or `DarkTheme` or by implementing the `Theme` interface. 

After you create the theme, you'll need to register it by calling:

```php
// overwrite the default light theme
Solo::registerTheme('light', AaronsAwesomeLightTheme::class);

// or create something totally new
Solo::registerTheme('synth', SynthWave::class);
```

### Modifying the dashboard

If you want, you can register a new Renderer to render the entire dashboard. This is out of scope for documentation and only for the brave of heart, but once you do you can register it thusly:

```php
Solo::setRenderer(MyFancyDashboardRenderer::class);
```

## Allowing packages to register commands

By default, packages are not allowed to register commands. If they do register commands, they'll be marked as "unsafe." They'll still show up on your dashboard, but they will not run.

To allow a package to register a command, you must add the caller to your service provider:

```php
Solo::allowCommandsAddedFrom([
  // Note that Pint doesn't actually register Solo commands, this is just an example!
  \Laravel\Pint\PintServiceProvider::class,
]);
```

## Contributing
Please help.

I haven't tested this on Windows, I don't have a Windows machine!

Also there are gonna be _so_ many edge cases with commands, terminals, etc. I need a good way to test these things. If you're good at testing, please help me set up a good scaffold.
