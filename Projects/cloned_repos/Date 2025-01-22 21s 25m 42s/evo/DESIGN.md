# Evo Design Document

Below is a high-level overview of Evo's goals and design choices, intended to help new contributors understand the project and see how everything fits together.

Evo is an offline-first, tree-based version control system (VCS) that aims to improve on traditional workflows by providing:

1. User-friendly commands (no steep learning curve)
2. Ephemeral workspaces instead of complicated branch pointers
3. Advanced merges, including structural merges for JSON/YAML
4. A built-in HTTP server for push/pull
5. Optional commit signing and verification with Ed25519
6. Large file support (LFS-like mechanism)
7. Fine-grained concurrency with subdirectory/file-level locks
8. Focus on clarity and simplicity over opaque complexities

The system is implemented in Go, with an easily maintainable, extensible architecture.

## Key Goals

### 1. Simplicity & Approachability
- Minimize mental overhead: commands like `init`, `commit`, `sync`, `revert`, `workspace merge` should cover 90%+ of day-to-day tasks
- Provide straightforward conflict resolution steps and structural merges for common file types

### 2. Offline-First Distribution
- Every developer has a complete local repository, including all commits and file data
- The network is only required for syncing changes to a remote server, so one can commit, revert, and merge entirely offline

### 3. Production-Grade Reliability
- DAG-based commits with cryptographic hashes ensure integrity
- Fine-grained locking for concurrency support
- Real revert logic that inverts actual file diffs
- Built-in server for push/pull, user auth, and hosting

### 4. Enterprise & Open-Source Friendly
- Secure commit signing & verification
- Large file support
- Extensible design: easy to add new merge strategies, custom authentication backends, or specialized deployment configurations

## Core Design Choices

### 1. Custom .evo/ Format

Unlike Git's .git/, Evo maintains its own repository structure:

- **objects/**
  - Stores commits (`<commit-hash>.json`), tree objects (`<tree-hash>.json`), and binary blobs (`blobs/<blob-hash>`)
- **refs/**
  - Contains reference files (like `refs/origin`, `refs/main`) if you choose to keep named references
- **workspaces/**
  - Holds ephemeral workspace references (`workspaces/<workspace-name>`)
- **staging/**
  - Tracks partial staging information if a user commits with `--partial`
- **keys/**
  - Stores encryption-protected private keys and public keys for signing
- **config/**
  - Houses user settings (like `user.json` for name/email), remote URLs, or other repository-level config

### 2. Tree-Based Commits

Each commit references a tree object, which is effectively a snapshot of every file path mapped to a blob hash. This design:
- Makes it straightforward to see which files changed between commits by comparing trees
- Allows partial staging, revert operations, and merges at a file or even sub-file level if we store structural diffs

### 3. Renaming "HEAD"

To differentiate from Git's "HEAD," Evo uses `ACTIVE` as the name of the current commit reference. This is purely cosmetic but emphasizes that we're building something distinct from Git.

### 4. Ephemeral Workspaces

Instead of long-lived branches with numerous merges, Evo uses ephemeral "workspaces":
- Users create a workspace (`evo workspace create feature-xyz`) which references the current `ACTIVE` commit
- They switch to the workspace to do local commits
- They eventually merge the workspace back into `ACTIVE` (or another workspace)
- After merging, the workspace reference can be cleared

This approach encourages short-lived feature spaces, reduces confusion about merging older, stale branches, and fosters simpler merges.

### 5. Advanced Merge & Conflict Resolution

We provide a structural merge engine for JSON/YAML file types, plus a line-based fallback for everything else. N-way merges are supported by iteratively merging each parent's tree. Future expansions (e.g., merging XML or domain-specific file types) are straightforward to add via plugins in `internal/plugins`.

### 6. Commit Signing & Verification

Commits can be optionally signed with an Ed25519 private key. Evo can store passphrase-protected private keys in `.evo/keys/`. On `evo log`, you'll see if each commit is "verified" or not. This ensures authenticity and integrity in large or distributed teams.

### 7. Large File Support

Files exceeding a threshold (e.g., 5MB) can be moved into `.evo/largefiles` automatically, leaving a small "stub" behind in the working directory. This keeps repository sizes more manageable.

### 8. Fine-Grained Concurrency

We use a combination of in-memory locks (Go `sync.Mutex`) keyed by subdirectory or resource, ensuring multiple Evo commands or server requests can run without corrupting references. In the future, these can be replaced or augmented by file-based locking if needed.

### 9. Built-In HTTP Server

Running `evo server` launches an HTTP service for:
- Pull (`GET /pull`) to list known commits
- Push (`POST /push`) to upload missing commit objects
- Get Objects (`GET /objects/<hash>`) to fetch specific commit or tree data

This allows you to self-host Evo on any system. The server also includes stubbed endpoints (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`) for user authentication, which can be expanded to meet enterprise needs (OAuth, LDAP, etc.).

### 10. Friendly CLI

Commands revolve around the core tasks:
```bash
evo init      # Initialize a new Evo repo
evo status    # List added, modified, deleted, or renamed files
evo commit    # Capture changes in a new commit. --sign to sign, --partial for staged-only
evo revert    # Invert a specific commit's changes
evo workspace # Manage ephemeral workspaces (create, switch, merge, list)
evo sync      # Pull from remote, handle merges if needed, then push local commits
evo log       # Show commit history in descending time order (with optional signature verification)
evo server    # Start an Evo server instance for push/pull hosting
```

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork or Clone the Repo
- Standard GitHub flow if the project is hosted on GH. Or get Evo from the official source.

### 2. Set Up Your Environment
- You'll need Go 1.20+ installed
- Run `go build ./cmd/evo` to produce the evo binary

### 3. Branch/Workspace for Features
- Use `evo workspace create <feature>` to start new features, or rely on normal Git branching if you're just storing code in a Git repo for now

### 4. Coding Conventions
- The codebase is broken into `internal/core`, `internal/server`, `internal/commands`, etc.
- Keep your changes modular: if you're adding a new type of merge plugin, place it in `internal/plugins/`
- If you're altering the CLI, look in `internal/commands/`
- For concurrency or data structures, check `internal/core/`

### 5. Add Tests
- We encourage adding tests in a `tests/` or alongside relevant packages
- For merges, revert logic, or large files, test real-world scenarios and corner cases

### 6. Open a Pull Request (if using GitHub or a similar platform)
- Provide a brief description of your changes, referencing any open issues or planned features
- We'll review and discuss as needed

## Future Roadmap

- **More Detailed Renames**: The current rename detection is naive. We plan to implement more robust logic (like comparing file similarity thresholds) to track renames accurately
- **Improved Conflict UI**: An interactive conflict-resolution mode for merges, guiding the user through each file's conflict
- **Tree Compression / Packfiles**: Similar to Git's packfiles, for more efficient storage in huge repos
- **Extended Server Features**: Full user auth management, code reviews, integrated CI triggers, etc.
- **GUI Clients**: Although Evo is CLI-first, we welcome community-driven GUIs

## Summary

Evo aims to reinvent the developer experience of version control by focusing on clarity, simpler branching (workspaces), advanced merges, and robust offline support. Thanks to Go's concurrency features, built-in cryptographic libraries, and static binary distribution, it can serve small teams or large enterprises with minimal overhead.

We look forward to your contributionsâ€”whether that's adding new merge strategies, refining the commit process, or extending the server's capabilities. Welcome to Evo!
